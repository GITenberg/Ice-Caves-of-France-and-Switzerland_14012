<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The existence of natural ice-caves at depths varying from 50 to 200
feet below the surface of the earth, unconnected with glaciers or snow
mountains, and in latitudes and at altitudes where ice could not under
ordinary circumstances be supposed to exist, has attracted some attention
on the Continent; but little or nothing seems to be practically known in
England on the subject. These caves are so singular, and many of them so
well repay inspection, that a description of the twelve which I have
visited can scarcely, as it seems to me, be considered an uncalled-for
addition to the numerous books of travel which are constantly appearing.
In order to prevent my narrative from being a mere dry record of natural
phenomena, I have interspersed it with such incidents of travel as may be
interesting in themselves or useful to those who are inclined to follow my
steps. I have also given, from various sources, accounts of similar caves
in different parts of the world.</p>

<p>A pamphlet on <i>Glaci&egrave;res Naturelles</i> by M. Thury, of
Geneva, of the existence of which I was not aware when I commenced my
explorations, has been of great service to me. M. Thury had only visited
three glaci&egrave;res when he published his pamphlet in<!-- Page vi --><a
name="Page_vi"></a> 1861, but the observations he records are very
valuable. He had attempted to visit a fourth, when, unfortunately, the
want of a ladder of sufficient length stopped him.</p>

<p>I was allowed to read Papers before the British Association at Bath
(1864), in the Chemical Section, on the prismatic formation of the ice in
these caves, and in the Geological Section, on their general character and
the possible causes of their existence.</p>

<p>It is necessary to say, with regard to the sections given in this book,
that, while the proportions of the masses of ice are in accordance with
measurements taken on the spot, the interior height of many of the caves,
and the curves of the roof and sides, are put in with a free hand, some of
them from memory. And of the measurements, too, it is only fair to say
that they were taken for the most part under very unfavourable
circumstances, in dark caves lighted by one, or sometimes by two candles,
with a temperature varying from slightly above to slightly below the
freezing-point, and with no surer foot-hold than that afforded by slippery
slopes of ice and chaotic blocks of stone. In all cases, errors are due to
want of skill, not of honesty; and I hope that they do not generally lie
on the side of exaggeration.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF LA GENOLLI&Egrave;RE, IN THE JURA.</h3>

<p>In the summer of 1861, I found myself, with some members of my family,
in a small rustic <i>pension</i> in the village of Arzier, one of the
highest villages of the pleasant slope by which the Jura passes down to
the Lake of Geneva. The son of the house was an intelligent man, with a
good knowledge of the natural curiosities which abound in that remarkable
range of hills, and under his guidance we saw many strange things. More
than once, he spoke of the existence of a <i>glaci&egrave;re</i> at no
great distance, and talked of taking us to see it; but we were sceptical
on the subject, imagining that <i>glaci&egrave;re</i> was his patois for
<i>glacier</i>, and knowing that anything of the glacier kind was out of
the question. At last, however, on a hot day in August, we set off with
him, armed, at his request, with candles; and, after two or three hours of
pine forests, and grass glades, and imaginary paths up rocky ranges of
hill towards the summits of the Jura, we came to a deep natural pit, down
the side of which we scrambled. At the bottom, after penetrating a few
yards into a chasm in the rock, we discovered a small low cave, perfectly
dark, with a flooring of ice, and a pillar of the same material in the
form of a <a name="Page_2"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;2]</span></a>
headless woman, one of whose shoulders we eventually carried off, to
regale our parched friends at Arzier. We lighted up the cave with candles,
and sat crouched on the ice drinking our wine, finding water, which served
the double purpose of icing and diluting the wine, in small basins in the
floor of ice, formed apparently by drops falling from the roof of the
cave.</p>

<p>A few days after, our guide and companion took us to an ice-cavern on a
larger scale, which, we were told, supplies Geneva with ice when the
ordinary stores of that town fail; and the next year my sisters went to
yet another, where, however, they did not reach the ice, as the ladder
necessary for the final drop was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>In the course of the last year or two, I have mentioned these
glaci&egrave;res now and then in England, and no one has seemed to know
anything about them; so I determined, in the spring of 1864, to spend a
part of the summer in examining the three we had already seen or heard of,
and discovering, if possible, the existence of similar caves.</p>

<p>The first that came under my notice was the Glaci&egrave;re of La
Genolli&egrave;re; and, though it is smaller and less interesting than
most of those which I afterwards visited, many of its general features are
merely reproduced on a larger scale in them. I shall therefore commence
with this cave, and proceed with the account of my explorations in their
natural order. It is probable that some of the earlier details may seem to
be somewhat tedious, but they are necessary for a proper understanding of
the subject.</p>

<p>La Genolli&egrave;re is the <i>montagne</i>, or mountain pasturage and
wood, belonging to the village of Genollier, an ancient priory of the
monks of S. Claude.<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The cave itself lies at <a name="Page_3">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;3]</span></a> no great distance from
Arzier--a village which may be seen in profile from the Grand Quai of
Geneva, ambitiously climbing towards the summit of the last slope of the
Jura. To reach the cave from Geneva, it would be necessary to take train
or steamer to Nyon, whence an early omnibus runs to S. Cergues, if
crawling up the serpentine road can be called running; and from S. Cergues
a guide must be taken across the Fruiti&egrave;re de Nyon, if anyone can
be found who knows the way. From Arzier, however, which is nine miles up
from Nyon, it was not necessary to take the S. Cergues route; and we went
straight through the woods, past the site of an old convent and its
drained fish-pond, and up the various rocky ridges of hill, with no guide
beyond the recollection of the previous visits two and three years before,
and a sort of idea that we must go north-west. As it was not yet July, the
cows had not made their summer move to the higher ch&acirc;lets, and we
found the mountains uninhabited and still.</p>

<p>The point to be made for is the upper Ch&acirc;let of La
Genolli&egrave;re, called by some of the people <i>La Baronne</i>, <a
name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> though the
district map puts La Baronne at some distance from the site of the
glaci&egrave;re. We had some difficulty in finding the ch&acirc;let, and
were obliged to spread out now and <a name="Page_4"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;4]</span></a> then, that each might hunt a specified portion of
the wood or glade for signs to guide our further advance, enjoying
meanwhile the lilies of the mountain and lilies of the valley, and fixing
upon curious trees and plants as landmarks for our return. In crossing the
last grass, we found the earliest vanilla orchis (<i>Orchis nigra</i>) of
the year, and came upon beds of moonwort (<i>Botrychium Lunaria</i>) of so
unusual a size that our progress ceased till such time as the finest
specimens were secured.</p>

<p>Some time before reaching this point, we caught a glimpse of a dark
speck on the highest summit in sight, which recalled pleasantly a night we
had spent there three years before for the purpose of seeing the sun
rise.<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> My
sisters had revisited the Ch&acirc;let des Ch&egrave;vres, which this dark
speck represented, in 1862, and found that the small chamber in which we
had slept on planks and logs had become a more total ruin than before, in
the course of the winter, so that it is now utterly untenable.</p>

<p>From Arzier to the Ch&acirc;let of La Genolli&egrave;re, would be about
two hours, for a man walking and mounting quickly, and never losing the
way; and the glaci&egrave;re lies a few minutes farther to the north-west,
at an elevation of about 2,800 feet above the lake, or 4,000 feet above
the sea. <a name="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>A
rough mountain road, leading over an undulating expanse of grass, passes
narrowly between two small clumps of trees, each surrounded by a low
circular wall, the longer diameter of the enclosure on the south side of
the road being 60 feet. In this enclosure is a natural pit, of which the
north side is a sheer rock, of the ordinary limestone of the Jura, with a
chasm almost from the top; while the south side is less steep, and affords
the means of scrambling down to the <a name="Page_5"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;5]</span></a> bottom, where a cave is found at the
foot of the chasm, passing under the road. The floor of this small but
comparatively lofty cave is 52 feet below the surface of the earth, and
slopes away rapidly to the west, where, by the help of candles, the rock
which forms the wall is seen to stop short of the floor, leaving an
entrance 2 or 3 feet high to an inner cave--the glaci&egrave;re. The roof
of this inner cave rises slightly, and its floor falls, so that there is a
height of about 6 feet inside, excepting where a large open fissure in the
roof passes high up towards the world above. At one end, neither the roof
nor the floor slopes much, and in this part of the cave the height is less
than 3 feet.</p>

<p>It would be very imprudent to go straight into an ice-cave after a long
walk on a hot summer's day, so we prepared to dine under the shade of the
trees at the edge of the pit, and I went down into the cave for a few
moments to get a piece of ice for our wine. My first impression was that
the glaci&egrave;re was entirely destroyed, for the outer cave was a mere
chaos of rock and stones; but, on further investigation, it turned out
that the ruin had not reached the inner cave. In our previous visit we had
noticed a natural basin of some size and depth among the trees on the
north side of the road, and we now found that the chaos was the result of
a recent falling-in of this basin; so that from the bottom of the first
cave, standing as it were under the road, we could see daylight through
the newly-formed hole.</p>

<p>The total length of the floor of the inner cave, which lies north-east
and south-west, is 51 feet; and of this floor a length of about 37 feet
was more or less covered with ice, the greatest breadth of the ice being
within an inch or two of 11 feet. Excepting in the part of the cave
already mentioned as being less than 3 feet high, we found the floor not
nearly so dry, nor so completely covered with ice, as when we first saw
the glaci&egrave;re, three years before, in <a name="Page_6"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;6]</span></a> the middle of an exceptionally hot
August. Under the low roof all was very dry, though even there the ice had
not an average thickness of more than 8 inches. It may be as well to say,
once for all, that the ice in these caves is never found in a sheet on a
pool of water; it is always solid, forming the floor of the cave, filling
up the interstices of the loose stones, and rising above them, in this
case with a surface perfectly level.</p>

<br />
 <span class="caption">ICE-COLUMNS IN THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF LA
GENOLLI&Egrave;RE.</span></p>

<p>We found four principal columns of ice, three of which, in the loftiest
part of the cave, are represented in the accompanying engraving: I call
them three, and not two, because the two which unite in a common base
proceeded from different fissures. The line of light at the foot of the
rock-wall is the only entrance to the glaci&egrave;re. The lowest column
was 11-2/3 feet high and 1-2/3 feet broad, not more than 6 inches thick in
the middle, half-way up, and flattened symmetrically so as <a name=
"Page_7"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;7]</span></a> to be
comparatively sharp at the edges, like a huge double-edged sword. It stood
clear of the rock through its whole height, but scarcely left room between
itself and the wall of the cave for a candle to be passed up and down. The
other two columns shown in the engraving poured out of fissures in the
rock, streaming down as cascades, the one being 13-1/2 and the other 15
feet high; and when we tied a candle to the end of an alpenstock, and
passed it into the fissures, we found that the bend of the fissures
prevented our seeing the termination of the ice. An intermittent
disturbance of the air in these fissures made the flame flicker at
intervals, though generally the candle burned steadily in them, and we
could detect no current in the cave. The fourth column was in the low part
of the cave, and we were obliged to grovel on the ice to get its
dimensions: it was 3-1/4 feet broad and 4-1/3 feet high, the roof of the
cave being only 2-3/4 feet high; and it poured out of the vertical fissure
like a smooth round fall of water, adhering lightly to the rock at its
upper end like a fungus, and growing out suddenly in its full size. This
column was dry, whereas on the others there were abundant symptoms of
moisture, as if small quantities of water were trickling down them from
their fissures, though the fissures themselves appeared to be perfectly
dry.</p>

<p>In one of the fissures there was a patch of what is known as
sweating-stone, <a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> with globules of water oozing out, and
standing roundly upon it: the globules were not frozen. This stone was
exceedingly hard, and defied all our efforts to break off a specimen, but
at last we got two small pieces, hard and heavy, and wrapped them in
paper; ten weeks after, we found them of course quite dry, and broke them
easily, small as they were, with our fingers. The fissure <a name=
"Page_8"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;8]</span></a> from which the
shortest of the four columns came was full of gnats, as were also several
crevices in the walls of the cave, especially in the lowest part; and we
found a number of large red-brown flies, <a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> nearly an inch long, running rapidly on
the ice and stones, after the fashion of the flies with which trout love
best to be taken. The central parts of the cave, where the roof is high,
were in a state provincially known as 'sloppy,' and drops of water fell
now and then from above, either splashing on wet stones, or hollowing out
basins in the remaining ice, or, sometimes, shrewdly detecting the most
sensitive spot in the back of the human neck. We placed one of Casella's
thermometers on a piece of wood on one of the wet stones, clear of the
ice, and it soon fell to 34&deg;. Probably the temperature had been
somewhat raised by the continued presence of three human beings and two
lighted candles in the small cavern; and, at any rate, the cold of two
degrees above freezing was something very real on a hot summer's day, and
told considerably upon my sisters, so that we were compelled to beat a
retreat,--not quite in time, for one of our party could not effect a thaw,
even by stamping about violently in the full afternoon sun.</p>

<p>While we were in the cave, we noticed that the surfaces of the columns
were covered by very irregular lines, marked somewhat deeply in the ice,
and dividing the surface into areas of all shapes, a sort of network, with
meshes of many different shapes and sizes. These areas were smaller
towards the edges of the columns; the lines containing them were not, as a
rule, straight lines, and almost baffled our efforts to count them, but,
to the best of my belief, there were meshes with three, four, and up to
eight sides. The column which stood clear of the rock was composed of very
<a name="Page_9"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;9]</span></a> limpid
ice, without admixture of air; but the cascades were interpenetrated by
veins of looser white ice, and, where the white ice came, the surface
lines seemed to disappear. As we sat on the grass outside, arranging our
properties for departure, my attention was arrested by the columnar
appearance of the fractured edge of the block of ice which we had used at
luncheon. It was about 5 inches thick, and had formed part of a stalagmite
whose horizontal section, like that of the free column, would be an
ellipse of considerable eccentricity; and, on examination, it turned out
that the surface areas, which varied in size from a large thumb-nail to
something very small, were the ends of prisms reaching through to the
other side of the piece of ice, at any rate in the thinner parts, and
presenting there similar faces. Not only so, but the prisms could be
detached with great ease, by using no instrument more violent than the
fingers; while the point of a thin knife entered freely at any of the
surface lines, and split the ice neatly down the sides of the prisms. When
one or two of the sides of a prism were exposed, at the edge of the piece
of ice, the prism could be pushed out entire, like a knot from the edge of
a piece of wood. In some cases there seemed to be capillary fissures
coincident with the lines where several sides of prisms met. Considering
the shape of the whole column, it is clear that the two ends of each prism
could not be parallel; neither was one of the ends perfectly symmetrical
with the other, and I do not think that the prisms were of the nature of
truncated pyramids. On descending again, I found that the columns were
without exception formed of this prismatic ice, either in whole, as in the
clear column, or in part, as where limpid prisms existed among the white
ice which ran in veins down the cascades. In the free vertical column the
prisms seemed to be deposited horizontally, and in the thicker parts they
<a name="Page_10"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;10]</span></a> did not
pass clear through. We carried a large piece of ice down to Arzier in a
botanical tin, and on our arrival there we found that all traces of
external lines had disappeared.</p>

<p>This visit to the glaci&egrave;re was on Saturday, and on the following
Monday I determined to go up alone, to take a registering thermometer, and
leave it in the cave for the night; which, of course, would entail a third
visit on the next day. Monday brought a steady penetrating rain, of that
peculiar character which six Scotch springs had taught me to describe as
'just a bit must;' while in the higher regions the fog was so hopeless,
that a sudden lift of the mist revealed the unpleasant fact that
considerable progress had been made in a westerly direction, the true line
being north-west. Instead of the rocks of La Genolli&egrave;re, the
foreground presented was the base of the D&ocirc;le, and the chasm which
affords a passage from the well-known fortress of Les Rousses into Vaud.
There was nothing for it but to turn in the right direction, or attempt to
do so, and force a way through the wet woods till something should turn
up. This something took the form of a ch&acirc;let; but no amount of
hammering and shouting produced any response, and it was only after a
forcible entrance, and a prolonged course of interior shouting, that a man
was at length drawn. He said that he had been asleep--and why he put it in
a past tense is still a mystery--and could give no idea of the direction
of the ch&acirc;let on La Genolli&egrave;re, beyond a vague suggestion
that it was somewhere in the mist; a suggestion by no means improbable,
seeing that the mist was ubiquitous. One piece of information he was able
to give, and it was consoling: I was now, it seemed, on the
Fruiti&egrave;re de Nyon, and therefore the desired ch&acirc;let could not
be far off, if only a guide could be found. On the whole, he thought that
a guide could <a name="Page_11"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;11]</span></a> not be found; but there were men in the
ch&acirc;let, and I might go up the ladder with him and see what could be
done. He led to a chamber with a window of one small pane, dating
apparently from the first invention of glass, and never cleaned since. An
invisible corner of the room was appealed to; but the voice which resided
there, and seemed like everything else to be asleep, pleaded dreamily a
total ignorance of the whereabouts of the ch&acirc;let in question. Just
as, by dint of steady staring through the darkness, an indistinct form of
a mattress, with a human being reclining thereon, began to be visible,
another dark corner announced that this new speaker had heard of a <i>
p'tit sentier</i> leading to the ch&acirc;let, but knew neither direction
nor distance. Here the space between the two corners put in a word; and,
as the darkness was now becoming natural, seven or eight mattresses
appeared, ranged round the room, some holding one, some two men, most of
whom were sitting up on end with old caps on, displaying every variety of
squalor. The voice which had spoken last declared that the distance was
three-quarters of an hour, and that if the day were clear there would be
no difficulty in reaching the ch&acirc;let; as it was, the man would be
very glad to try.</p>

<p>A change of cap was the only dressing necessary for the volunteer, and
we faced the fog and rain, which elicited from him such a disgraceful
amount of swearing, that it was on all accounts well when the rain ceased
for a few minutes, the mists rolled off, and the clouds lifted
sufficiently to betray the surface of the Lake of Geneva, luxuriating in
the clear warmth of an early summer's day, and making us shiver by the
painful contrast which our own altitude presented. The deep blue of the
lake brought to mind the story of the shepherd of Gessenay (Saanen), of
whom it is told that when he was passing the hills with <a name="Page_12">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;12]</span></a> some friends for a first
visit to Vevey, and came in sight of the lake, which he had never seen
before, he turned and hurried home incontinent, declaring that he would
not enter a country where the good God had made the blue sky to fall and
fill the valleys.</p>

<p>In this bright interval we came upon a magnificent fox, and the
peasant's impulse was, 'Oh, for a good gun!' an exclamation which would
have sounded horrible to English ears, if I had not been previously broken
in to it by an invitation from a Scotch gamekeeper to a fox-hunt, when he
promised an excellent gun, and a <i>stance</i> which the foxes were sure
to pass.</p>

<p>The rain now came on again, and the guide thought he had had plenty of
it, and must return for the afternoon milking; and just then, as good luck
would have it, we stumbled upon an immense clump of nettles which had been
one of our landmarks two days before, so that he was no longer necessary,
and we said affectionate adieux.</p>

<p>The glaci&egrave;re was in a state of ruin. Only the right-hand column,
not speaking heraldically, was standing, the others lying in blocks frozen
hard together on the ground. The column which still stood was much
shrunken, and seemed too small for its fissure, the sides of which it
scarcely touched. The wind blew down the entrance slope so determinedly,
that a candle found it difficult to live at the bottom of the first cave;
and a portion of the current blew into the glaci&egrave;re, and in its
sweep exactly struck the fallen columns, the edges of which were already
rounded by thaw. Much of this must be attributed to the recent opening of
the second shaft (p. 5), which admits a thorough draught through the first
cave, and so exposes the glaci&egrave;re to currents of warmer air; and I
should expect to find that in future the ice will disappear from that part
<a name="Page_13"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;13]</span></a> of the
cave every summer, <a name="FNanchor7"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> whereas in 1861 we found it thick and dry
(excepting a few small basins containing water) and evidently permanent,
in the middle of a very hot August. The low part of the cave was so
completely protected from the current, that the candle burned there quite
steadily for an hour and a half: still, like the others, the column at
that end of the glaci&egrave;re was broken down, and it therefore became
necessary to attribute its fall to some other agency than the current of
external air. There had been a very large amount of rain, and the surface
of the rock in the fissures was evidently wet; so I have no doubt that the
filtering through of the warm rain-water had thawed the upper supports of
the ice-cascades, and then, owing to their slightly inclined position, the
pedestal had not provided sufficient support, and so they had fallen. One
of them, perhaps, had brought down in its fall the free column, which had
stood two days before on its own base, without any support from the rock.
Very probably, too--indeed, almost certainly,--the fall of the large mass
of rock, which once formed the bottom of the basin on the north side of
the road, has affected the old-established fissures, by which rain-water
has been accustomed to penetrate in small quantities to the
glaci&egrave;re, so that now a much larger amount is admitted. On this
account, there will probably be a great diminution of the ice in the
course of future summers, though the amount formed each winter may be
greater than it has hitherto been. Constant examination of other columns
and fissures has convinced me, that, before the end of autumn, the
majority of the glaci&egrave;res will have lost all the columns which
depend upon the roof for a part of their support, or spring from fissures
in the wall; whereas those which are true stalagmites, and <a name=
"Page_14"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;14]</span></a> are
self-supporting, will have a much better chance of remaining through the
warm season, and lasting till the winter, and so increasing in size from
year to year. Free stalagmites, however, which are formed under fissures
capable of pouring down a large amount of water on the occasion of a great
flood of rain, must succumb in time, though not so soon as the supported
columns.</p>

<p>A curious appearance was presented by a small free stalagmite in the
retired part of the cave. The surface of the stalagmite was wet, from the
drops proceeding from a fissure above, and was lightly covered in many
parts with a calcareous deposit, brought down from the fissures in the
roof by the water filtering through. The stalagmite was of the
double-edged-sword shape, and the limestone deposit collected chiefly at
one of its edges, the edge nearer to that part of the cave where thaw
prevailed; so that the real edge was a ridge of deposit beyond the edge of
the ice.<a name="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
Patches of limestone paste lay on many parts of the ice-floor.</p>

<p>In the loftier part of the cave, water dropped from the roof to so
large an extent, that ninety-six drops of water in a minute splashed on to
a small stone immediately under the main fissure. This stone was in the
centre of a considerable area of the floor which was clear of ice; and it
struck me that if the columns were formed by the freezing of water
dropping from the roof, there ought to have been at some time a large
column under this, the most plentiful source of water in the cave.
Accordingly, I found that the edge of the ice round this clear area was
much thicker than the rest of the ice of the floor, and was evidently the
remains of the swelling pedestal of a column which had been about 12 feet
in circumference. This departed column may account for a fact which I
discovered in <a name="Page_15"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;15]</span></a> another glaci&egrave;re, and found to be of very
common occurrence, viz., that in large stalagmites there is a considerable
internal cavity, extending some feet up from the ground, and affording
room even for a man to walk about inside the column. When the melted snows
of spring send down to the cave, through the fissures of the rock, an
abundance of water at a very low temperature, and the cave itself is
stored with the winter's cold, these thicker rings of ice catch first the
descending water, and so a circular wall, naturally conical, is formed
round the area of stones; the remaining water either running off through
the interstices, or forming a floor of ice of less thickness, which yields
to the next summer's drops. In the course of time, this conical wall
rises, narrowing always, till a dome-like roof is at length formed, and
thenceforth the column is solid. Of course, the interior cannot be wholly
free from ice; and it will be seen from the account of one of these
cavities, which I explored in the Schafloch, that they are decked with ice
precisely as might be expected. <a name="FNanchor9"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Another possible explanation of this
curious and beautiful phenomenon will be given hereafter.<a name=
"FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p>The temperature was half a degree lower than when there were three of
us in the cave two days before. I deposited one of Casella's registering
thermometers, on wood, on a stone in that part of the floor which was free
from ice, though there was ice all round it at some little distance. The
thermometer was well above the surface of the ice, and was protected from
chance drops of water from the roof.</p>

<p>The next morning I started early from Arzier, having an afternoon
journey in prospect to the neighbourhood of another glaci&egrave;re, and
was accompanied by Captain Douglas Smith, of the 4th Regiment. On our way
to La Genolli&egrave;re, <a name="Page_16"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;16]</span></a> we came across the man who had served as guide
the day before, and a short conversation respecting the glaci&egrave;re
ensued. He had only seen it once, many years before, and he held stoutly
to the usual belief of the peasantry, that the ice is formed in summer,
and melts in winter; a belief which everything I had then seen
contradicted. His last words as we parted were, '<i>Plus il fait chaud,
plus &ccedil;a g&egrave;le</i>;' and, paradoxical as it may appear, I
believe that some truth was concealed in what he said, though not as he
meant it. Considering that his ideas were confined to his cattle and their
requirements, and that water is often very difficult to find in that part
of the Jura, a <i>hot</i> summer would probably mean with him a <i>dry</i>
summer, that is, a summer which does not send down much water to thaw the
columns in the cave. Extra heat in the air outside, at any season, does
not, as experience of these caves proves abundantly, produce very
considerable disturbance of their low temperature, and so summer water is
a much worse enemy than extra summer heat; and if the caves could be
protected from water in the hot season, the columns in them would know how
to resist the possible--but very small--increase of temperature due to the
excess of heat of one summer above another. And since the eye is most
struck by the appearance of the stalagmites and ice-cascades, it may well
be that the peasants have seen these standing at the end of an unusually
hot and dry summer, and have thence concluded that hot summers are the
best time for the formation of ice. Of course, at the beginning of the
winter after a hot summer, there will be on these terms a larger nucleus
of ice; and so it will become true that the hotter the year, the more ice
there will be, both during the summer itself and after the following
winter.</p>

<p>The further process of the formation of ice will be this:--the colds of
early winter will freeze all the water that <a name="Page_17"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;17]</span></a> may be in the glaci&egrave;res from
the summer's thaw, in such caves as do not possess a drainage, and then
the frost will have nothing to occupy itself upon but the ice already
formed, for no water can descend from the frost-bound surface of the
earth.<a name="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
As soon as the snow begins to melt to so great a degree that the fissures
are opened up once more, the extremely cold water resulting therefrom will
descend through the limestone into a cave perfectly dry, and filled with
an atmosphere many degrees below the freezing point, whose frost-power
eagerly lays hold of every drop of water which does not make its escape in
time by the drainage of the cave. Thus the spring months will be the great
time of the formation of ice, and also of the raising of the temperature
from some degrees below freezing to the more temperate register at which I
have generally found it, viz., rather above than below 32&deg;. Professor
Tyndall very properly likens the external atmosphere to a ratchet-wheel,
from its property of allowing the passage of hot rays down to the surface
of the earth, and resisting their return: it may equally be so described
on other grounds, inasmuch as the cold and heavy atmosphere will sink in
the winter into the pits which lead to glaci&egrave;res, and will refuse
to be altogether displaced in summer by anything short of solar
radiation.</p>

<p>We found the one column of the previous day still <a name="Page_18">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;18]</span></a> standing, though evidently
in an unhappy state of decay. The sharpness of its edges was wholly gone,
and it was withered and contorted; there were two cracks completely
through it, dividing it into three pieces 4 or 5 feet long, which were
clearly on the point of coming down. Externally, the day was fine and
warm, and so we found the cave comparatively dry, only one drop falling in
a minute on to the stone where ninety-six had fallen in the same time the
day before. The thermometer registered 32&deg; as the greatest cold of the
night, and still stood at that point when we took it up.</p>

<p>We spent some little time in exploring the neighbourhood of the pits,
in order to find, if possible, the outlet for the drainage, but the ground
did not fall away sufficiently for any source from so low an origin to
show itself. The search was suggested by what I remembered of the
Glaci&egrave;re of S. Georges three years before, where the people believe
that a small streamlet which issues from the bottom of a steep rock, some
distance off, owes its existence to the glaci&egrave;re.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF S. GEORGES, IN THE JURA.</h3>

<p>The best way of reaching this glaci&egrave;re from Geneva would be to
take the steamer to Rolle, or the train to one of the neighbouring
stations, between Geneva and Lausanne, and thence pass up the slope of the
Jura by the road which leads through Gimel. For the train, the Allaman
station would be the most convenient, as an omnibus runs from Allaman to
Aubonne, where the poste for Gimel may be caught. But from Arzier there is
a short cut of less than two hours along the side of the hills, leaving
that village by a deep gorge not unfitly named <i>L'Enfer</i>, and a dark
wood which retains an odour of more savage bygone times in its name of the
'Bear's Wood,' as containing a cavern where an old bear was detected in
the act of attempting to winter.<a name="FNanchor12"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p>The village of S. Georges has very respectable accommodation for a
single traveller, <i>au Cavalier</i>. The common day-room will be found
untenable by most Englishmen, however largely they may delight in rough
quarters; but there is a double-bedded room at the end of a bricked
passage up-stairs, which serves well for bedroom and sitting-room in one.
The chief drawback in this arrangement is, <a name="Page_20"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;20]</span></a> that the landlady inexorably removes
all washing apparatus during the day, holding that a pitcher and basin are
unseemly ornaments for a sitting-room. The deal table, of course, serves
both for dressing and for feeding purposes, but it is fortunately so long
that an end can be devoted to each; and on the whole it is possible to
become considerably attached to the room, with its three airy windows, and
the cool unceasing hum of a babbling fountain in the village-street below.
The Auberge is a large building, with a clock-tower of considerable
height, containing the clock of the commune: as soon as the candle is put
out at night, it becomes painfully evident that a rectangular projection
in one corner of the room is in connection with this tower, and in fact
forms a part of the abode of the pendulum, which plods on with audible
vigour, growing more and more audible as the hours pass on, and making a
stealthy pervading noise, as if a couple of lazy ghosts were threshing
phantom wheat. The clocks of Vaud, too, are in the habit of striking the
hour twice, with a short interval; so that if anyone is not sure what the
clock meant the first time, he has a second chance of counting the
strokes. This is no doubt an admirable plan under ordinary circumstances,
but it does certainly try the patience of a sleepless dyspeptic after a
surfeit of caf&eacute;-au-lait and honey; and when he has counted
carefully the first time, and is bristling with the consciousness that it
is only midnight, it is aggravating in the extreme to have the long slow
story told a second time within a few feet of his head.</p>

<p>The Cavalier had retained a guide overnight, Henri Renaud by name, and
he appeared punctually at eight o'clock in the morning, got up in the
short-tail coat of the country, and a large green umbrella with mighty
ribs of whalebone. The weather was extremely unpleasant, a cold pitiless
rain rendering all attempts at protection <a name="Page_21"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;21]</span></a> unavailing; but, fortunately, the
glaci&egrave;re is only an hour and a quarter from the village. The path
is tolerably steep, leading across the <i>petit Pr&eacute; de Rolle</i>,
and through woods of beech and fir, till the summit of one of the minor
ridges of the Jura is reached, whence a short descent leads to the mouth
of the glaci&egrave;re, something more than 4,000 feet above the sea. The
ground here slopes down towards the north; and on the slope, among
fir-trees, an irregular circular basin is seen, some seven or eight yards
across,<a name="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
and perhaps two yards deep, at the bottom of which are two holes. One of
these holes is open, and as the guide and I--for my sisters remained at
Arzier--stood on the neck of ground between the holes, we could see the
snow lying at the bottom of the cave; the other is covered with trunks of
trees, laid over the mouth to prevent the rays of the sun from striking
down on to the ice. This protection has become necessary in consequence of
an incautious felling of wood in the immediate neighbourhood of the mouth,
which has exposed the ice to the assaults of the weather. The commune has
let the glaci&egrave;re for a term of nine years, receiving six or seven
hundred francs in all; and the <i>fermier</i> extracts the ice, and sells
it in Geneva and Lausanne. In hot summers, the supplies of the artificial
ice-houses fail; and then the hotel-keepers have recourse to the stores
laid up for them by nature in the Glaci&egrave;res of S. Georges and S.
Livres. Hence the importance of protecting the ice; the necessity for so
doing arising in this case from the fact that the entrance to the cave is
by a hole in the roof, which exposes the ice to direct radiation, unlike
all other glaci&egrave;res, excepting perhaps the <i>Cueva del Hielo</i>
on the Peak of Teneriffe.<a name="FNanchor14"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Page_22"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;22]</span></a>

<p>Autumn appears to be the usual time for cutting the ice, when it is
carried from the cave on men's backs as far as the commencement of the
rough mountain-road, and is there packed on chars, and so conveyed to the
nearest railway station. Renaud had worked in the cave for two years, and
asserted that they did not choose the night for carrying the ice down to
the station, and did not even care to choose a cool day. He believed that,
in the autumn of 1863, they loaded two chars a day for fifteen days, and
each char took from 40 to 50 quintaux; the quintal containing 50 kilos, or
100 livres.<a name="FNanchor15"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> In Professor Pictet's time (1822) this
glaci&egrave;re supplied the Hospital of Geneva, whose income depended in
part on its privilege of <i>revente</i> of all ice sold in the town, with
25 quintaux every other day during the summer. In my anxiety to learn the
exact amount of ice now supplied by the glaci&egrave;re, I determined to
find out the <i>fermier</i>; but Renaud could tell nothing of him beyond
the fact that he lived in Geneva, which some promiscuous person
supplemented by the information that his name was Boucqueville, and that
he had something to do with comestibles. On entering upon a hunt for M.
Boucqueville a fortnight later, it turned out that no one had heard of
such a person, and the Directory professed equal ignorance; but, under the
head of 'Comestibles,' there appeared a Gignoux-Bocquet, No. 34,
March&eacute;. Thirty-four, March&eacute;, said, yes--M. Bocquet--it was
quite true: nevertheless, it was clear that monsieur meant Sebastian
a&icirc;n&eacute;, on the Molard. The Molard knew only a younger
Sebastian, but suggested that the right man was probably M.
Gignoux-Chavaz, over the way; and when it was objected that
Gignoux-Bocquet, and not Gignoux-Chavaz, was the name, the Molard replied
that it made no matter,--Chavaz or Bocquet, it was all the same. <a name=
"Page_23"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;23]</span></a> When M.
Gignoux-Chavaz was found, he said that he certainly was a man who had
something to do with a glaci&egrave;re, but, instead of farming the
Glaci&egrave;re of S. Georges, he had only bought a considerable quantity
of ice two years ago from the Glaci&egrave;re of S. Livres, and he did not
believe that the <i>fermier</i> of S. Georges lived in Geneva. Part of the
confusion was due to the custom of placing a wife's maiden name after her
husband's name: thus Gignoux-Chavaz implies that a male Gignoux has
married a female Chavaz; and when a Swiss marries an English lady with a
very English name, the result in the Continental mouth is sufficiently
curious.</p>

<p>On arriving at the entrance to the glaci&egrave;re, the end of a
suggestive ladder is seen under the protecting trunks; and after one or
two steps have been taken down the ladder, the effect of the cave below is
extremely remarkable, the main features being a long wall covered thickly
with white ice in sheets, a solid floor of darker-coloured ice, and a high
pyramid of snow reaching up towards the uncovered hole already spoken of.
The atmosphere of the cave is damp, and this causes the ladders to fall
speedily to decay, so that they are by no means to be trusted: indeed, an
early round gave way under one of my sisters, when they visited the cave
with me in 1861, and suggested a clear fall of 60 feet on to a cascade of
ice.<a name="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
There are three ladders, one below the other, and a hasty measurement gave
their lengths as 20, 16, and 28 feet. The rock-roof is only <a name=
"Page_24"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;24]</span></a> a few feet thick
in the neighbourhood of the hole of entrance.</p>

<div class="centerme"><img alt="ENTRANCE TO THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF S.
GEORGES." src="images/image2.jpg" width="348" height="361" /><br />
<span class="caption">ENTRANCE TO THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF S.
GEORGES.</span></div>

<p>The total length of the cave is 110 feet, lying NE. and SW., in the
line of the main chain of the Jura. The lowest part of the floor is a sea
of ice of unknown depth, 45 feet long by 15 broad; and Renaud tried my
powers of belief by asserting that in 1834 the level of this floor was
higher by half the height of the cave than now; a statement, however,
which is fully borne out by Professor Pictet's measurements in 1822, when
the depth of the glaci&egrave;re was less than 30 feet. Indeed, the floor
had sunk considerably since my previous visit, when it was all at the same
level down to the further end of the cave; whereas now, <a name="Page_25">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;25]</span></a> as will be seen in the
section, there was a platform of stones resting on ice at that end. There
are two large fissures passing into the rock, one only of which can be
represented in the section, and these were full of white ice, not owing
its whiteness apparently to the admixture of air in bubbles, but firm and
compact, and very hard, almost like porcelain. Small stalactites hung from
round fissures in the roof, formed of the same sort of ice, and broken off
short, much as the end of a leaden pipe is sometimes seen to project from
a wall. With this exception, there was no ice hanging from the roof,
though there were abundant signs of very fine columns which had already
yielded to the advancing warmth: one of these still remained, in the form
of broken blocks of ice, in the neighbourhood of the open hole in the
roof, immediately below which hole the stones of the floor were completely
bare, and the thermometer stood at 50&deg;. At the far end of the cave,
the thermometer gave something less than 32&deg;; a difference so
remarkable, at the same horizontal level, that I am inclined to doubt the
accuracy of the figures, though they were registered on the spot with due
care. The uncovered hole, it must be remembered, is so large, and so
completely open, that the rain falls freely on to the stones on the floor
below.</p>

<p>By far the most striking part of this glaci&egrave;re is the north-west
wall, which is covered with a sheet of ice 70 feet long, and 22 feet high
at the highest part: in the neighbourhood of the ladders, this turns the
corner of the cave, and passes up for about 9 feet under the second
ladder. The general thickness of the sheet is from a foot to a foot and a
half; and this is the chief source from which the <i>fermier</i> draws the
ice, as it is much more easily quarried than the solid floor. Some of my
friends went to the cave a few weeks after my visit, and found that the
whole sheet had been pared off and carried away.</p>

<a name="Page_26"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;26]</span></a>

<div class="centerme"><img alt=" VERTICAL SECTIONS OF THE GLACI&Egrave;RE
OF S. GEORGES." src="images/image3.jpg" width="390" height="219" /><br />
 <span class="caption">VERTICAL SECTIONS OF THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF S.
GEORGES.</span></div>

<a name="Page_27"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;27]</span></a>

<p>On some parts of the wall the sheet was not completely continuous,
being formed of broad and distinct cascades, connected by cross channels
of ice, and uniting at their upper and lower ends, thus presenting many
curious and ornamental groupings. On cutting through this ice, it was
found not to lie closely on the rock, a small intermediate space being
generally left, almost filled with minute limestone particles in a very
wet state; and the whole cavern showed signs of more or less thaw.</p>

<p>It was natural to examine the structure of the ice in this
glaci&egrave;re, after what we had observed on La Genolli&egrave;re. The
same prismatic structure was universal in the sheet on the wall, and in
the blocks which lay here and there on the floor and formed the sole
remains of former columns. It was to be observed also in many parts of the
ice-floor itself. The base of one large column still remained standing in
its original position, and its upper end presented a tolerably accurate
horizontal section of the column. The centre was composed of turbid ice,
round which limpid prisms were horizontally arranged, diverging like the
feathers of a fan; then came a ring of turbid ice, and then a second
concentric ring of limpid prisms, diverging in the same manner as those
which formed the inner ring. There were in all three or four of these
concentric rings, the details showing a considerable amount of confusion
and interference: the general law, however, was most evident, and has held
in all the similar columns which I have since examined in other
glaci&egrave;res. The rings were not accurately circular, but presented
rather the appearance of having been formed round a roughly-fluted pillar
on an elliptical base.</p>

<p>The examination of the ice on the wall gave some curious results. The
horizontal arrangement of the prisms, which we had found to prevail in
vertical columns, was <a name="Page_28"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;28]</span></a> here modified to suit the altered conditions of
the case, and the axes of the prisms changed their inclination so as to be
always perpendicular to the surface on which the ice lay, as far as could
be determined by the eye. Thus, in following the many changes of
inclination of the wall, the axes of the prisms stood at many different
angles with the vertical, from a horizontal position where the wall
chanced to be vertical, to a vertical position on the horizontal ledges of
the rock. The extreme edges, too, of the ice, presented a very peculiar
appearance. The general thickness, as has been said, varied from a foot to
a foot and a half; and this diminished gradually along horizontal lines,
till, at the edges of the sheet, where the ice ceased, it became of course
nothing. The extreme edge was formed of globular or hemispherical beads of
ice, like the freezing of a sweating-stone, lying so loosely on the rock
that I could sweep them off in detail with one hand, and catch them with
the other as they fell. Passing farther on towards the thicker parts of
the ice, these beads stood up higher and higher, losing their roundness,
and becoming compressed into prisms of all shapes, in very irregular
imitation of the cellular tissue in plants, the axes of the prisms
following the generally-observed law. There seems to be nothing in this
phenomenon which cannot be accounted for by the supposition of gradual
thaw of small amount being applied to a sheet of prismatic ice.</p>

<p>One fact was remarkable from its universal appearance. Wherever an
incision was made in this sheet of ice, the prisms snapped off at the
depth of an inch, and could be mowed down like corn by means of a stout
knife. Although they broke naturally at this constant depth, and left a
surface of limpid ice without any signs of external or internal division,
still the laminae obtained by chiselling this lower surface carefully,
broke up regularly into the <a name="Page_29"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;29]</span></a> shapes to be expected in sections of prisms cut
at right angles to the axis. The roughness of my instruments made it
impossible to discover how far this extended, and whether it ceased to be
the case at any given depth in the ice.</p>

<p>The sea of ice on the floor was in a very wet state at the surface,
being at a lower level than the stones on to which the rain from the open
hole fell; and here the prismatic structure was not apparent to the eye,
nor do I know whether it existed at all. In the Glaci&egrave;re of La
Genolli&egrave;re I carried a large block of perfectly prismatic ice into
the outer cave, where it was exposed to the free currents of air passing
from the pit of entrance to the hole newly opened by the falling in of the
ground; and, two days after, the external lines were scarcely perceptible,
while on the occasion of our third visit I found that they had entirely
disappeared, and the whole block was rapidly following their example. This
disappearance of the surface-lines under the action of atmospheric thaw is
probably the same thing as their absence when the flooring of ice is
thinly covered with water. Wherever the flooring rose slightly towards the
edges of the sea of ice, the usual structure appeared again.</p>

<p>There were no currents of air in the cave, the candles burning steadily
through the whole time of our visit. Excepting for the purpose of
detecting disturbance in the air, there is no need of candles, as the two
holes in the roof supply sufficient light. Some account of the careful
observations made here by M. Thury, at different seasons of the year, will
be found in other parts of this book. We passed, on our return, by the
source of water which springs from the foot of a rock at some distance
from the glaci&egrave;re, and is supposed to form the outlet for the
drainage of the cave; but it is difficult to understand how this <a name=
"Page_30"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;30]</span></a> can be the case,
considering the form and character of the intervening ground.</p>

<p>The two ice-caves so far described are the least interesting of all
that I have visited; but a peasant informed me, a day or two after, that
if we had penetrated to the back of the pyramid of snow which lay half
under the open hole, being the remains of the large collection which is
formed there in the winter, we might have found a deep pit which is
sometimes exposed by the melting of the snow. He had some idea that its
depth was 30 feet a few years ago, and that its sides were solid ice. I
shall have occasion to mention such pits in another glaci&egrave;re; if
one does exist here, it has probably been quarried in the ice by the drops
from the hole in the roof, and there might be some interest attached to an
attempt to investigate it.<a name="FNanchor17"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p>We reached S. Georges again in a wretched state of wet and cold, and
Renaud went off to bed, and imbibed abundant and super-abundant
kirsch,--at least, when drawn thence the next morning, his manner left no
doubt about either the fact or the abundance of the potations overnight.
Warned by many experiences, I had gone no nearer to a specification of the
bill of fare than a vague suggestion that <i>quelque chose</i> must be
forthcoming, with an additional stipulation that this must be something
more than mere onions and fat. The landlady's rendering of <i>quelque
chose</i> was very agreeable, but, for the benefit of future diners <i>au
Cavalier</i>, it is as well to say that those who do not like anisette had
better make a private arrangement with their hostess, otherwise they will
swallow with their soup an amount sufficient for many generations of the
drag: they may also safely order savoury rice, with browned veal and
wine-sauce, which is evidently a strong point with the Cavalier. All meals
there are picturesque; for the omelette <a name="Page_31"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;31]</span></a> lay on the Castle of Grandson and a
part of the Lake of Neufch&acirc;tel, while the butter reposed on the
ruined Cathedral of Sion, and the honey distilled pleasantly from the comb
on to the walls of Wufflens. No one should put any trust in the spoons,
which are constructed apparently of pewter shavings in a chronic state of
semi-fusion. On the evening of the second day, the landlady allowed a
second knife at tea, as the knife-of-all-work had begun to knock up under
the heavy strain upon its powers; but this supplementary instrument was of
the ornamental kind, and, like other ornamental things, broke down at a
crisis, which took the form of a piece of crust.</p>

<p>Lest this account should raise anyone's expectations too high, it is as
well to add that they have no snuffers in S. Georges, beyond such as
Nature provided when she gave men fingers; and they burn attenuated tallow
candles with full-bodied wicks. Also, the tea is flavoured with vanille,
unless that precious flavouring is omitted by private contract.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE LOWER GLACI&Egrave;RE OF THE PR&Eacute; DE S. LIVRES.</h3>

<p>I had intended to walk on from S. Georges to Bi&egrave;re, after
returning from the glaci&egrave;re last described, and thence, the next
morning, to the Pr&eacute; de S. Livres, the mountain pasturage of the
commune of S. Livres,<a name="FNanchor18"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> a village near Aubonne. But Renaud
advised a change of plan, and the result showed that his advice was good.
He said that the <i>fermier</i> of the Glaci&egrave;re of S. Livres
generally lived in S. Georges, and, if he were at home, would be the best
guide to the glaci&egrave;re; while the distance from S. Georges was, if
anything, rather less than the distance from Bi&egrave;re; so that by
remaining at the Cavalier for another night the walk to Bi&egrave;re would
be saved, and the possibility of finding no competent guide there would be
evaded. Jules Mignot, the farmer in question, was at home, and promised to
go to the glaci&egrave;re in the morning, pledging his word and all that
he was worth for the existence and soundness of the ladders; a matter of
considerable importance, for M. Thury had been unable to reach the ice, as
also my sisters, by reason of a failure in this respect.</p>

<a name="Page_33"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;33]</span></a>

<p>In the course of the evening Mignot came in, and confidentially took
the other chair. He wished to state that he had three <i>
associ&eacute;s</i> in working the glaci&egrave;re, and that one of them
knew of a similar cave, half an hour from the one more generally known;
the <i>associ&eacute;</i> had found it two years before, and had not seen
it since, and he believed that no one else knew where it was to be found.
If I cared to visit it, the <i>associ&eacute;</i> would accompany us, but
there was some particular reason--here he relapsed into patois--why this
other man could not by himself serve as guide to both glaci&egrave;res. As
this meant that I must have two guides, and suggested that perhaps the
right rendering of <i>associ&eacute;</i> was 'accomplice,' the negotiation
nearly came to a violent end; but the farmer was so extremely explanatory
and convincing, that I gave him another chance, asking him how much the
two meant to have, and telling him that, although I could not see the
necessity for two guides, I only wished to do what was right. He expressed
his conviction of the truth of this statement with such fervour, that I
could only hope his moderation might be as great as his faith. He took the
usual five minutes to make up his mind what to say, going through abstruse
calculations with a brow demonstratively bent, and, to all appearance,
reckoning up exactly what was the least it could be done for, consistently
with his duty to himself and his family. Then he asked, with an air of
resignation, as if he were throwing himself and his <i>associ&eacute;</i>
away, 'Fifteen francs, then, would monsieur consider too much?'
'Certainly, far too much; twelve francs would be enormous. But, for the
pleasure of his company and that of his friend, I should be happy to give
that sum for the two, and they must feed themselves.' He jumped at the
offer, with an alacrity which showed that I had much under-estimated his
margin in putting it at three francs; and with many <a name="Page_34">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;34]</span></a> expressions of
anticipatory gratitude, and promises of axes and ropes in case of
emergency, he bowed himself out. The event proved that both the men were
really valuable, and they got something over the six francs a-piece.</p>

<p>The rain had been steadily increasing in intensity for the last
twenty-four hours, from the insidious steeping of a Scotch mist to the
violence of a chronic thunderstorm, and had about reached this crisis when
we started in the morning for the Pr&eacute; de S. Livres. I had already
tested its effects before breakfast, in a search for the Renaud of the day
before, who had made statements regarding the ice at S. Georges, and the
time of cutting it, which a night's reflection showed to be false. To
search for Henri Renaud in the village of S. Georges, was something like
making an enquiry of a certain porter for the rooms of Mr. John Jones. The
landlady of the Cavalier was responsible for the first stage of the
journey, asserting that he lived two doors beyond the next auberge,
evidently with a feeling that it was wrong so far to patronise the rival
house as to live near it. That, however, was not the same Henri Renaud;
and a house a few yards off was recommended as a likely place, where,
instead of Henri, a Louis Renaud turned up, shivering under the eaves in
company with the <i>fermier</i>, who introduced Louis in due form as the
accomplice. They received conjointly and submissively a lecture on the
absurdity of calling it a rainy morning, and the impossibility of staying
at home, even if it came on much worse, and then pointed the way to the
true Henri Renaud, half-way down the village. When I arrived at the place
indicated, and consulted a promiscuous Swiss as to the abode of the object
of my search, he exclaimed, 'Henri Renaud? I am he.' 'But,' it was
objected, 'it is the <i>marchand de bois</i> who is wanted.' 'Precisely,
Henri Renaud, marchand de bois; it is I.' 'But, it is the cutter <a name=
"Page_35"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;35]</span></a> of ice in the
glaci&egrave;re.' 'Ah, a different Henri. That Henri is in bed in the
house yonder,' and so at last he was found. When finally unearthed, Henri
confessed that when he had said <i>spring</i> the day before, he ought to
have said <i>autumn</i>, and that by autumn he meant November and
December. Enquiries elsewhere showed that the end of summer was what he
really meant, if he meant to tell the truth.</p>

<p>Our route for the glaci&egrave;re followed the high road which leads by
the Asile de Marchairuz to La Vall&eacute;e, as far as the well-known
Ch&acirc;let de la S. Georges; and then the character of the way changed
rapidly for the worse, and we took to the wet woods. After a time, the
wood ceased for a while, and a large expanse of smooth rock showed itself,
rising slightly from the horizontal, and so slippery in its present wet
condition that we could not pass up it. Then woods again, and then the
montagnes of <i>Sous la Roche</i>, and <i>La Foireuse</i>, till at last,
in two hours, the Pr&eacute; de S. Livres was achieved. The fog was so
dense that nothing could be seen of the general lie of the country; but
the <i>thalweg</i> was a sufficient guide, and after due perseverance we
came upon the glaci&egrave;re, not many yards from that line, on the north
slope of the open valley, about 4,500 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>To prevent cattle from falling into the pit, a wall has been built
round the trees in which it lies. The circumference of this wall is 435
feet, but there are so many trees at the upper end of the enclosure that
this gives an exaggerated idea of the size of the pit. The men fed while
the preliminary measurements were being made; and when this was
accomplished, they pressed their bottle of wine upon me so hospitably that
I was obliged to antedate the result which its appearance promised, and
plead <i>mal d'estomac</i>. Of all things, it is most unwise to give a
reason for a <a name="Page_36"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;36]</span></a> negative, and so it proved in this instance; for
they promptly felicitated themselves and me on the good luck by which it
happened that they had brought a wine famous on all the c&ocirc;te as a
remedy for that somewhat vague complaint--a homoeopathic remedy in
allopathic doses.</p>

<p>The glaci&egrave;re is entered by a natural pit in the gentle slope of
grass, not much unlike the pit of La Genolli&egrave;re, but wider, and
covered at the bottom with snow.<a name="FNanchor19"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> The first ladder leads down to a ledge
of rock on which bushes and trees grow, and this ledge it is possible to
reach without a ladder; the next ladder leads on to the deep snow, and
descent by any ordinary manner of climbing is in this case quite
impossible.<a name="FNanchor20"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> The snow slopes down towards a lofty
arch in the rock which forms the north-west side of the pit, and this arch
is the entrance to the glaci&egrave;re; it is 28-3/4 feet wide, and as
soon as we passed under it we found that the snow became ice, and it was
necessary to cut steps; for the surface of underground ice is so slippery,
unlike the surface of ordinary glaciers, that the slightest defect <a
name="Page_37"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;37]</span></a> from the
horizontal makes the use of the axe advisable. The stream of ice falls
gradually, spreading out laterally like a fan, so as to accommodate itself
to the shape of the cave, which it fills up to the side walls; it
increases in breadth from 28-3/4 feet at the top to 72 feet at the bottom
of the slope, and the distance from the top of the first ladder to this
point is 177 feet. Here we were arrested by a strange wall of ice 22 feet
high, down which there seemed at first no means of passing; but finding an
old ladder frozen into a part of the wall, we chopped out holes between
the upper steps, and so descended, landing on a flooring composed of
broken blocks and columns of ice, with a certain amount of what seemed to
be drifted snow. This wall of ice, which was 72 feet long and 22 feet
high, was not vertical, but sloped the wrong way, caving in under the
stream of ice; and from the projecting top of the wall a long fringe of
vast icicles hung down, along the whole breadth of the fan. The effect of
this was, that we could walk between the ice-wall and the icicles as in a
cloister, with solid ice on the one hand and Gothic arcades of ice on the
other, the floor being likewise of ice, and the roof formed by the
junction of the wall with the top of the icicle-arcade. The floor of this
cloister was not 22 feet below the top of the wall, for it formed the
upper part of a gentle descending slope of ice, rounded off like a fall of
water, which seemed to flow from the lower part of the wall; and the
height of 22 feet is reckoned from the foot of this slope, which
terminated at a few feet of horizontal distance from the foot of the wall.
The wall of ice was plainly marked with horizontal bands, corresponding,
no doubt, to a number of years of successive deposits; sometimes a few
leaves, but more generally a strip of minuter d&eacute;bris, signified the
divisions between the annual layers. There had been many columns of ice <a
name="Page_38"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;38]</span></a> from
fissures in the rock, but all had fallen except one large ice-cascade,
which flowed from a hole in the side of the cave on to the main stream,
about two-thirds of the distance down from the snow. One particularly
grand column had stood on the very edge of the ice-wall, and its remains
now lay below.</p>

<p>The flooring of mingled ice and snow, on which we stood, sloped through
about five vertical feet from the foot of the wall, and came to an end on
broken rocks, from which the terminal wall of the cave sprang up. The
effect of the view from this point, as we looked up the long slope of ice
to where the ladders and a small piece of sky were visible, was most
striking. The accompanying engraving is from a sketch which attempts to
represent it; the reality is much less prim, and much more full of
beautiful detail, but still the engraving gives a fair idea of the general
appearance of the cave.</p>

<p>While I was occupied in making sketches and measurements, Mignot was
engaged in chopping discontentedly at the floor, in two or three different
places. At length he seemed to find a place to his mind, and chopped
perseveringly till his axe went through, and then he suggested that we
should follow. The hole was not tempting. It opened into the blackest
possible darkness, and Mignot thrust his legs through, feeling for a
foothold, which, by lowering himself almost to his armpits, he soon
discovered: the foothold, however, proved to be a loose stone, which gave
way under him and bounded down, apparently over an incline of like stones,
to a distance which sounded very alarming. But he would not give in, and
at length, descending still further by means of the snow in which the hole
was made, he was rewarded by finding a solid block which bore his weight,
and he speedily disappeared altogether, summoning me to follow. I proposed
to light <a name="Page_39"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;39]</span></a>
a candle first, not caring to go through such a hole, in such a floor,
into no one knew what; but he was so very peremptory, evidently thinking
that if he had gone through without a pioneering candle his monsieur might
do the same, that there was nothing for it but to obey. The hole was very
near the junction of the floor with the slope of stones where the floor
terminated, and the space between the hole and the slope seemed to be
filled up with a confused mass of snow and ice, in which the snow largely
<a name="Page_40"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;40]</span></a>
predominated; so that there was good hold for hands and feet in passing
down to the stones, which might be about 7 feet below the upper surface of
the floor.</p>

 <span class="caption">LOWER GLACI&Egrave;RE OF THE PR&Eacute; DE S.
LIVRES.</span></div>

<p>Here we crouched in the darkness, with our faces turned away from the
presumed slope of stones, till a light was struck. The accomplice did not
find it in the bond that he should go down, and he preferred to reserve
his energies for his own peculiar glaci&egrave;re.</p>

<p>As soon as the candle had mastered a portion of the darkness, we found
that we were squatting on a steeply sloping descent of large blocks of
stone, while in face of us was a magnificent wall of ice, evidently the
continuation of the wall above, marked most plainly with horizontal lines.
This wall passed down vertically to join the slope on which we were, at a
depth below our feet which the light of the candle had not yet fathomed.
The horizontal bands were so clear, that, if we had possessed climbing
apparatus, we could have counted the number of layers with accuracy. Of
course we scrambled down the stones, and found after a time that the angle
formed by the ice-wall and the slope of stones was choked up at the bottom
by large pieces of rock, one piled on another just as they had fallen from
the higher parts. These blocks were so large, that we were able to get
down among the interstices, in a spiral manner, for some little distance;
and when we were finally stopped, still the ice-wall passed on below our
feet, and there was no possible chance of determining to what depth it
went. The atmosphere at this point was a sort of frozen vapour, most
unpleasant in all respects, and the candles burned very dimly. The
thermometer stood at 32&deg;, half-way down the slope of stones.</p>

<p>We were able to stretch a string in a straight line from the lowest
point we reached, through the interstices of the blocks of stone, and up
to the entrance-hole, and this <a name="Page_41"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;41]</span></a> measurement gave 50 feet. Considering the
inclination of the upper ice-floor, and the sharpness of the angle between
the wall of ice and the line of our descent to this lowest point, I
believe that 50 feet will fairly represent the height of the ice-wall from
this point to the foot of the slope from the upper wall; so that 72 feet
will be the whole depth of ice, from the top of the third ladder to the
point where our further progress downwards was arrested. The correctness
of this calculation depends upon the honesty of Mignot, who had charge of
the farther end of the string, and was proud of the wonders of his
cave.</p>

<div class="centerme"><img alt="SECTION OF THE LOWER GLACI&Egrave;RE OF
THE PR&Eacute; DE S. LIVRES." src="images/image5.jpg" width="294" height=
"327" /><br />
 <span class="caption">SECTION OF THE LOWER GLACI&Egrave;RE OF THE
PR&Eacute; DE S. LIVRES.</span></div>

<p>A dishonest <a name="Page_42"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;42]</span></a> man might easily, under the circumstances, have
pulled up a few feet more of string than was necessary, but 50 feet seemed
in no way an improbable result of the measurement.</p>

<p>The ice was as solid and firm as can well be conceived. The horizontal
bands would seem to prove conclusively that it was no coating of greater
or less thickness on the face of a vertical wall of rock, an idea which
might suggest itself to anyone who had not seen it, and I think it
probable that the amount of ice represented in the section of the cave is
not an exaggeration. We were unable to measure the whole length of the
wall in the lower cave, from the large number of blocks of stone which had
fallen at one end, and lay against its face. Probably, from the nature of
the case, it was not so long as the 72 feet of wall above; but we measured
50 feet, and could see it still passing on to the right hand as we faced
it. In trying to penetrate farther along the face, I found a wing of the
brown fly we had seen in considerable abundance on the ice in La
Genolli&egrave;re, frozen into the remains of a column.</p>

<p>There was so very much to be observed on all sides, and the
measurements took up so much time, owing to the peculiar difficulties
which attended them, that I did not examine with sufficient care the
curious floor of ice through which we cut our way to the lower cavern.
Neither did I notice the roof of the cavern thus reached, which may be
very different from the shape of the upper surface of the floor composing
it. If the ice-wall goes straight up, and the roof is formed of the
ice-floor alone, then it is a very remarkable feature indeed. But, more
probably, the lower wall leans over more and more towards the top, and so
forms as it were a part of the roof. It is possible that, as the wall has
grown, each successive annual layer has projected <a name="Page_43"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;43]</span></a> farther and farther, till at
last some year very favourable to the increase of ice has carried the
projection for that year nearly to the opposite stones, and then an
unfavourable year or two would form the foot of the upper wall. This seems
more probable, from the loose constitution of the floor at the point where
it joins the stones, as if it were there only made up of drift and
d&eacute;bris, while the part of the floor nearer the foot of the wall is
solid ice. It has been suggested to me that possibly water accumulates in
the time of greatest thaw to a very large extent in the lower parts of the
cave, and the ice-floor is formed where the frost first takes hold of this
water. But the slope of the ice-floor is against this theory, to a certain
extent; and the amount of water necessary to fill the cavity would be so
enormous, that it is contrary to all experience to imagine such a
collection, especially as the cave showed no signs of present thaw. The
appearance of the rocks, too, in the lower cave, and the surface of the
ice-wall there, gave no indications of the action of water; and there was
no trace of ice among the stones, as there certainly would have been if
water had filled the cave, and gradually retired before the attacks of
frost, or in consequence of the opening up of drainage. There were pieces
of the trunks of trees, also, and large bones, lying about at different
levels on the rocks. I never searched for bones in these caves, owing to
the absence of the stalagmitic covering which preserves cavern-bones from
decay; nor did I take any notice of such as presented themselves without
search, for the <i>bergers</i> are in the habit of throwing the carcases
of deceased cows into any deep hole in the neighbourhood of the place
where the carcases may be found, in consequence of the general belief that
living cows go mad if they find the grave of a companion; so that I should
probably have made a laborious collection of the bones of the <i>bos
domesticus</i>. <a name="Page_44"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;44]</span></a></p>

<p>This belief of the bergers respecting the cows is supported by several
circumstantial and apparently trustworthy accounts of fearful fights among
herds of cattle over the grave of some of the herd. The sight of a
companion's blood is said to have a similar effect upon them. Thus a small
pasturage between Anzeindaz and the Col de Cheville, on the border of the
cantons Vaud and Valais, is still called <i>Boulaire</i> from legendary
times, when the herdsmen of Vaud (then Berne) won back from certain
Valaisan thieves the cattle the latter were carrying off from La Varraz.
Some of the cows were wounded in the battle, and the sight of their blood
drove the others mad, so that they fought till almost all the herd was
destroyed; whence the name Boulaire, from <i>&eacute;bou&euml;ler</i>, to
disembowel,--a word formed from <i>bou&euml;</i>, the patois for <i>
boyau</i>.</p>

<p>When we left the lower darkness and ascended to the floor of ice once
more, Mignot expressed a desire to see my attempt at a sketch of the
glaci&egrave;re from that point, as he had been much struck during his
negotiatory visit of the night before by the sketch of the entrance to the
Glaci&egrave;re of S. Georges, chiefly because he had guessed what it was
meant for. He was evidently disappointed with the representation of his
own cave, for he could see nothing but a network of lines, with
unintelligible words written here and there, and after some hesitation he
confessed that it was not the least like it. A little explanation soon set
that right, and then he began to plead vigorously for the wall which
surrounded the trees at the mouth of the pit. Why was it not put in? He
was told, because it could not be seen from below; but nevertheless he
strongly urged its introduction, on the ground that he had built it
himself, and it was such a well-built wall; facts which far more than
balanced any little impossibility that might otherwise have prevented its
appearance. After we had reached the <a name="Page_45"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;45]</span></a> grass of the outer world again, he
made me sketch the entrance to the pit, pointing to the containing wall
with parental pride, and standing over the sketch-book and the sketcher
with an umbrella which speedily turned inside out under the combined
pressure of wind, and rain, and years; a feat which it had already
performed <i>des fois</i>, he said, in the course of his acquaintance with
it.</p>

<p>Before finally leaving the glaci&egrave;re, I examined the structure of
the great stream of ice, at different points near the top of the limiting
wall. From its outward appearance it might have been expected to be rough,
but it was not so; it was knotty to the eye, but perfectly smooth to the
foot, and, when cut, showed itself perfectly clear and limpid. It did not
separate under the axe into misshapen pieces, with faces of every possible
variation from regularity, that is, with what is called vitreous fracture,
but rather separated into a number of nuts of limpid ice, each being of a
prismatic form, and of much regularity in shape and size. It was smooth,
dark-grey, and clear; free from air, and free from surface lines; very
hard, and suggesting the idea of coarse internal granulation. In the large
ice-streams of some darker glaci&egrave;res, this ice assumed a rather
lighter colour by candle-light, but always presented the same granular
appearance, and cut up into the same prismatic nuts, and was evidently
free from constitutional opacity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>THE UPPER GLACI&Egrave;RE OF THE PR&Eacute; DE S. LIVRES.</h3>

<p>We now put ourselves under the guidance of the accomplice, Louis, who
began to express doubts of his ability to find the upper glaci&egrave;re,
administering consolation by reminding us that if he could not find it no
one else could.</p>

<p>As we walked on through the mist and rain, it became necessary to
circumvent a fierce-looking bull, and Mignot and the accomplice told rival
tales of the dangers to which pedestrians are exposed from the violence of
the cattle on some montagnes, where the bulls are allowed to grow to full
size and fierceness. Mignot was quite motherly in his advice and his
cautions, recommending as the surest safeguard a pocket-pistol, loaded
with powder only, to be flashed in the bull's face as he makes his charge.
When informed that in England an umbrella or a parasol is found to answer
this purpose, he shook his head negatively, evidently having no confidence
in his own umbrella, and doubting its obeying his wishes at the critical
moment; indeed, it would require a considerable time, and much care and
labour, to unfurl a lumbering instrument of that description. He had the
best of the tale-contest with Renaud in the end, for he had himself been
grazed by a bull which came up with him at the moment when he sprang into
a tree.</p>

<p>Before very long we reached a little kennel-like hut of boughs, which
no decent dog would have lived in, and no <a name="Page_47"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;47]</span></a> large dog could have entered, and from
this we drew a charcoal-burner. No, he said, he did not know the
glaci&egrave;re; he had heard that one had been discovered near there, and
he had spent hours in searching for it without success. A herdsman on his
way from one pasturage to another could give no better help, and we began
to despair, till at length Louis desired us to halt in a place sheltered
from the rain, while he prosecuted the search alone. We had abundant time
for observing that, like other leafy places sheltered from the rain, our
resting-place was commanded by huge and frequent drops of water; but at
last a joyful <i>Jodel</i> announced the success of the accomplice, and we
ran off to join him.</p>

<p>At first sight there was very little to see. Louis had lately been
enunciating an opinion that the cave was not worth visiting, and I now
felt inclined to agree with him. The general plan appeared to be much the
same as in the one we had just left, but the scale was considerably
smaller. The pit was not nearly so deep or so large, and, owing to the
falling-in of rock and earth at one side, the snow was approached by a
winding path with a gradual fall. As soon as the snow was reached, the
slope became very steep, and led promptly to an arch in the rock, where
the stream of ice began. The cave being shallow, the stream soon came to
an end, and, unlike that in the lower glaci&egrave;re, it filled the cave
down to the terminal wall, and did not fill it up to the left wall. Here
the ground of the cave was visible, strewn with the remains of columns,
and showing the thickness of the bottom of the stream to be about 6 feet
only. The arch of entrance had evidently been almost closed by a
succession of large columns, but these had succumbed to the rain and heat
to which they had been exposed by their position.</p>

<p>The left side of the cave, in descending, that is the west <a name=
"Page_48"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;48]</span></a> side, was
comparatively light, being in the line from the arch; but the other side
was quite dark, and after a time we found that the ice-stream, instead of
terminating as we had supposed with the wall of rock at the end of the
cavern, turned off to the right, and was lost in the darkness. Of course
candles were brought out, though Louis assured us that he had explored
this part of the cave on his previous visit, and had found that the right
wall of the cave very soon stopped the stream: we, on the contrary, by
tying a candle to a long stick, and thrusting it down the slope of ice,
found that the stream passed down extremely steeply, and poured under a
narrow and low arch in the wall of the cave, beyond which nothing could be
seen. We despatched pieces of ice along the slope, and could hear them
whizzing on after they had passed the arch, and landing apparently on
stones far below; so I called for the cords, and told Louis that we must
cut our way down. But, alas! the cords had been left at the other
glaci&egrave;re! One long bag, with a hole in the middle like an
old-fashioned purse, had carried the luncheon at one end and the ropes at
the other; and when the luncheon was finished, the bag had been stowed
away under safe trees till our return. This was of course immensely
annoying, and I rang the changes on the few words of abuse which invention
or knowledge supplied, as we sat damp and shivering on the verge of the
slope, idly sending down pieces of broken columns which brought forth
tantalising sounds from the subterranean regions. At length Renaud was
moved to shame, and declared that he would cut his way down, rope or no
rope; but this seemed so horribly hazardous a proceeding under all the
circumstances, that I forbad his attempting it. Seeing, however, that he
was determined to do something, we arranged ourselves into an apparatus
something like a sliding telescope. Louis cut a <a name="Page_49"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;49]</span></a> first step down the slope, and
there took his stand till such time as Mignot got a firm grasp of the tail
of his blouse with both hands, I meanwhile holding Mignot's tail with one
hand, and the long stick with the candle attached to it with the other;
thus professedly supporting the whole apparatus, and giving the necessary
light for the work. Even so, we tried again to persuade Renaud to give it
up, but he was warmed to his work, and really the arrangement answered
remarkably well: when he wished to descend to a new step, Mignot let out a
little blouse, and, being himself similarly relieved, descended likewise a
step, and then the remaining link of the chain followed. The leader
slipped once, but fortunately grasped a projecting piece of rock, for the
stream was here confined within narrow walls, and so the strength of the
apparatus was not tested; it could scarcely have stood any serious call
upon its powers.</p>

<p>After a considerable period of very slow progress, Renaud asked for the
candlestick, never more literally a stick than now, and thrust it under
the arch, stooping down so as to see what the farther darkness might
contain. We above could see nothing, but, after an anxious pause, he cried
<i>On peut aller!</i> with a lively satisfaction so completely shared by
Mignot, that that worthy person was on the point of letting Renaud's
blouse go, in order to indulge in gestures of delight. The step-cutting
went on merrily after this announcement, and one by one we came to the
arch and passed through, finding it rather a trough than an arch; the
breadth was about 4 feet, and the height from 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 feet, and, as
we pushed through, our breasts were pressed on to the ice, while our backs
scraped against the rock which formed the roof.</p>

<p>As soon as this trough was passed, the ice spread out like a fan, and
finally landed us in a subterranean cavern, <a name="Page_50"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;50]</span></a> 72 feet long by 36 feet broad, to
which this was the only entrance.</p>

<div class="centerme"><img alt="SECOND CAVE OF THE UPPER GLACI&Egrave;RE
OF THE PR&Eacute; DE S. LIVRES." src="images/image6.jpg" width="352"
height="350" /><br />
 <span class="caption">SECOND CAVE OF THE UPPER GLACI&Egrave;RE OF THE
PR&Eacute; DE S. LIVRES.</span></div>

<p>The breadth of the fan at the bottom was 27 feet; and near the archway
a very striking column poured from a vertical fissure in the wall, and
joined the main stream. The fissure was partially open to the cave, and
showed the solid round column within the rock: this column measured 18-1/2
feet in circumference, a little below the point where it became free of
the fissure, and it had a stream of ice 22 feet long pouring from its
base. The colour of the column was unusual, being a dull yellowish green,
and the peculiar structure of the ice gave the whole mass the appearance
of coursing down very rapidly, as if the water had been frozen while thus
moving, and had not therefore <a name="Page_51"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;51]</span></a> ceased so to move. At the bottom of the fan, the
flooring of the cave consisted of broken stones for a small space, and
then came a black lake of ice, which occupied all the centre of the cave,
and afforded us no opportunity of even guessing at its depth. From the
manner, however, in which it blended with the stones at its edge, I am not
inclined to believe that this depth was anything very great.</p>

<p>Renaud, in his impetuosity, had ceased to cut steps towards the bottom
of the slope, and had slipped down the last few feet, of course cutting
the remaining steps before attempting to reascend. We found him strutting
about the floor of the cave, tossing his wet cap in the air, and crying
<i>No one! No one! I the first!</i>, declining to take any part in
measurements until the full of his delight and pride had been poured out.
He shouted so loud that I was obliged to stop him, lest by some chance the
unwonted disturbance of the air should bring down an unstable block from
the roof of the arch, and seal us up for ever. There was no sign of
incipient thaw in the cave, and the air was very dry, so much so as at
once to call attention to the fact. At the farthest end, a lofty dome
opened up in the roof; and possibly at some time or other the rock may
here fall through, and afford another means of entrance. Beneath this dome
a very lovely cluster of columns had grouped itself, formed of the clear
porcelain-like ice, and fretted and festooned with the utmost delicacy, as
if Andersen's Ice Maiden had been there in one of her amiable moods, and
had built herself a palace. This dome in the roof was similar to many
which I afterwards observed in other glaci&egrave;res, being a vertical
fissure with flutings from top to bottom--not a spherical dome, but of
that more elegant shape which the female dress of modern times assumes on
a tall person.</p>

<a name="Page_52"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;52]</span></a>

<p>Between the base of the circular column and the wall, we found a rare
instance of clear jelly-like ice, without any lines external or internal,
such as is formed in the open air under very favourable circumstances.</p>

<br />
 <a name="FNanchor21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>[marker is in illustration]

<p>The ordinary number of undergraduate May Terms had afforded various
opportunities for studying the comparative clearness of different pieces
of ice, but certainly no one ever saw a lemon pippin through an inch and a
half of that material so clearly as we now saw the white rock through
1-1/2 feet. Mignot, indeed, said 2 feet; but it was his way to make a
large estimate of dimensions, and he constantly interrupted my record of
measurements by the assertion that I had made them <i>moins que plus</i>.
We were all disappointed by the actual size of the ice-fall which it had
cost us so much time and trouble to descend, the distance from the <a
name="Page_53"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;53]</span></a> first step
to the last being only 26 feet: as this, however, was given by a string
stretched from the one point to the other, and not following the concave
surface of the ice, the real distance was something more than this.</p>

<p>It was now getting rather late, considering the journey one of us had
yet to perform, and we walked quickly away from the glaci&egrave;re,
agreeing that it was not improbable that in that part of the Jura there
might be many hidden caves containing more or less ice, with no entrance
from the world outside, except the fissures which afford a way for the
water. The entrance to this cave was so small, that the same physical
effect might well be produced by one or two cracks in the rock, such as
every one is well acquainted with who has walked on the fissured limestone
summits of the lower mountains; and, indeed, Renaud positively affirmed
that at the time of his former visit there was not even this entrance to
the lower cave, for the ice-stream reached then a higher point of the
wall, and completely filled and hid the arch we had discovered. It is very
difficult to see how ice can exist in a cave which has no atmospheric
communication with the colds of winter, as would apparently be the case
with this cave if the one entrance were closed; but where the cracks and
small fissures in the rock do provide such communication, there is no
reason why we should not imagine all manner of glacial beauties decorating
unknown cavities, beyond the general physical law to which all the
glaci&egrave;res would seem to be exceptions.</p>

<p>Mignot now became communicative as to the amount of ice supplied by his
glaci&egrave;re, the lower of the two we had seen; and his statistics were
so utterly confused, that I gave him ten centimes and an address, and
charged him to write it all down from his account-book, and send it by
post. The letter was accordingly written on July 24, and after trying <a
name="Page_54"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;54]</span></a> many
unsuccessful addresses in various parts of Switzerland, it finally reached
England in the middle of September. It tells its own tale sufficiently
well, and is therefore given here with all the mistakes of the
original.</p>

<i>Dimanche</i>.</p>

<p>'JULES MIGNOT.'</p>

<p>Instead of three francs the quintal, Mignot had previously told me that
he got four francs, delivered at Gland, and five at Geneva. His ordinary
staff during the time of the exploitation was ten men to carry and load,
and two to cut the ice in the cave.</p>

<p>It was a matter of considerable importance to catch the Poste at Gimel,
and the two Swiss groaned loudly on the consequent pace, unnecessary, as
far as they were concerned, for the Poste was nothing to them. As a
general rule, the Swiss of this district cannot walk so fast as their
Burgundian or French neighbours, unless it is very much to their interest
to do so, and then they can go fast enough. A legend is still preserved in
the valleys of Joux and Les Rousses, to the following effect. While the
Franche Comt&eacute; was still Spanish, in 1648, commissioners were
appointed to fix the boundaries between Berne and Burgundy, on the other
side of the range of hill we were now descending, and they decided that
one of the boundary stones must be <a name="Page_56"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;56]</span></a> placed at the distance of a common
league from the Lake of Les Rousses. Unfortunately, no one could say what
a common league was, beyond the vague definition of 'an hour's walk;' so
two men were started from the shore of the lake, the one a Burgundian and
the other a Swiss, with directions to walk for an hour down the Orbe
towards Chenit, the stone to be placed half-way between the points they
should respectively reach at the end of the hour. It was for the interest
of the Franche Comt&eacute; that the stone should be as near the lake as
possible, and accordingly the Swiss champion made such walking as had
never been seen before, and gained for Berne a considerable amount of
territory. There was no such tragic result in this case as that which
induced the Carthaginians to pay divine honours to the brothers whose
speed, on a like occasion, had added an appreciable amount to the
possessions of the republic.</p>

<p>At length we reached the point where the roads for Gimel and S. Georges
separate, and there, under a glorious sapin, we said our adieux, and
wished our <i>au revoirs</i>, and settled those little matters which the
best friends must settle, when one is of the nature of a monsieur, and the
others are guides. They burdened their souls with many politenesses, and
so we parted. The inclemency of the weather was such, that the people in
the lower country asked, as they passed, whether snow had fallen in the
mountains, and the cold rain continued unceasingly down to the large plain
on which the Federal Camp of Bi&egrave;re<a name="FNanchor23"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> is placed. Here for a few moments the
sun showed itself, lighting up the white tents, and <a name="Page_57">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;57]</span></a> displaying to great
advantage the masses of scented orchises, and the feathery <i>
reine-des-pr&eacute;s</i>, which hemmed the road in on either side. All
through the earlier part of the day, flowers had forced themselves upon
our notice as mere vehicles for collected rain, when we came in contact
with them; but now, for a short time, they resumed their proper
place,--only for a short time, for the rain soon returned, and did not
cease till midnight. Not all the garden scenery about Aubonne and Allaman
(<i>ad Lemannum</i>), nor all the vineyards which yield the choice white
wine of the C&ocirc;te, could counterbalance the united discomfort of the
rain, and the cold which had got into the system in the two
glaci&egrave;res; and matters were not mended by the discovery that <i>
Bradshaw</i> was treacherous, and that a junction with dry baggage at
Neufch&acirc;tel could not be effected before eleven at night.</p>

<p>There are some curious natural phenomena in this neighbourhood, due to
the subterranean courses which the fissured limestone of the Jura affords
to the meteoric waters. Not far from Bi&egrave;re, the river Aubonne
springs out at the bottom of an amphitheatre of rock, receiving additions
soon after from a group of twenty natural pits, which the peasants call
unfathomable--an epithet freely applied to the strange holes found in the
Jura. It is remarkable that the way seems to stand at different levels in
the various pits.<a name="FNanchor24"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> The plain of Champagne, in which they
occur, is unlike the surrounding soil in being formed of calcareous
detritus, evidently brought down by <a name="Page_58"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;58]</span></a> some means or other from the Jura, and
is dry and parched up to the very edges of the pits. The Toleure, a
tributary of the Aubonne, frequently large enough to be called a
confluent, flows out from the foot of a wall of rock composed of regular
parallelopipeds, and in the spring, when the snows are melting freely, its
sources burst out at various levels of the rock. Farther to the west, the
Versoie, famous for its trout, pours forth a full-sized stream near the
Ch&acirc;teau of Divonne, which is said to take its name (<i>Divorum
unda</i>) from this phenomenon. Passing to the northern slope of this
range of the Jura, the Orbe is a remarkable example of the same sort of
thing, flowing out peacefully in very considerable bulk from an arch at
the bottom of a perpendicular rock of great height. This river no doubt
owes its origin to the superfluous waters of the Lake of Brenets, which
have no visible outlet, and sink into fissures and <i>entonnoirs</i> in
the rock at the edge of the lake. Notwithstanding that the lake is
three-quarters of a league distant, horizontally, and nearly 700 feet
higher, the belief had always been that it was the source of the stream,
and in 1776 this was proved to be the fact. For some years before that
date, the waters of the Lake of Joux had been inconveniently high, and the
people determined to clean out the <i>entonnoirs</i> and fissures of the
Lake of Brenets, which is only separated from the Lake of Joux by a narrow
tongue of land, in the expectation that the water would then pass away
more freely. In order to reach the fissures, they dammed up the outlet of
the upper into the lower lake; but the pressure on the embankment became
too great, and the waters burst through with much violence, creating an
immense disturbance <a name="Page_59"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;59]</span></a> in the lake; and the Orbe, which had always been
perfectly clear, was troubled and muddy for some little time. The source
of the Loue, near Pontarlier, is more striking than even that of the
Orbe.<a name="FNanchor25"></a><a href=

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF THE GR&Acirc;CE-DIEU, OR LA BAUME, NEAR
BESAN&Ccedil;ON.</h3>

<p>The grand and lovely scenery of the Val de Travers has at length been
opened up for the ordinary tourist world, by the railway which connects
Pontarlier with Neufch&acirc;tel. The beauties of the valley are an
unfortunate preparation for the dull expanse of ugly France which greets
the traveller passing north from the former town; but the country soon
assumes a pleasanter aspect, and nothing can be more charming than the
soft green slopes, dotted with the richest pines, which form the approach
to the station of Boujeailles. It is impossible for the most careless
traveller to avoid observing the ill effects produced upon the trees on
the south side of the forest of Chaux, by the crowded and neglected state
in which they have been left, and the wet state of the soil. The branches
become covered with moss, which first kills them, and then breaks them
off, so that many tall and tapering sapins point their heads to the sky
with trunks wholly guiltless of branches; while in other cases, where
decay has not yet gone so far, the branches wear the appearance of
gigantic stags' horns, with the velvet; and when a number of these
interlace, the mosses unite in large dark patches, giving a cedar-like air
to the scene of ruin.</p>

<p>Up to this point, an elderly Frenchman in the carriage had been
extremely offensive, from the evil odour of his Macintosh coat; but in <a
name="Page_61"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;61]</span></a> answer to a
remark upon the improvement which the railway would effect, by providing
ventilation for the forest, he gave so much information on that subject,
and gave it so pleasantly, and had evidently so good a knowledge of the
topography of Franche Comt&eacute;, that his coat speedily lost its smell,
and we became excellent friends.</p>

<p>It is a tantalising thing to be whirled on a hot and dusty day through
districts famous for their wines, the dust and heat standing out in more
painful colours by contrast with the recollection of cooling draughts
which other occasions have owed to such vineyards; though, after all, the
true method of facing heat with success is to drink no wine. At any rate,
the vineyards of Arbois must always be interesting, and if the stories of
the Templars' orgies be true, we may be sure that the chapelry which they
possessed in that town would be a favourable place of residence with the
order; possibly Rule XVI. might there be somewhat relaxed. 'The good wine
of Arbois,' <i>la meilleure cave de Bourgougne</i>, a judicious old writer
says, had free entry into all the towns of the Comt&eacute;; and when
Burgundy was becoming imperial, Maximilian extended this privilege through
all the towns of the empire. A hundred years later, it had so high a
character, that the troops of Henri IV. turned away from the town,
announcing that they did not wish to attack <i>ceulx estoient du naturel
de leur vin, qui frappe partout</i>;<a name="FNanchor26"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> and the king was forced to come
himself, with his constable and marshals, to beat down the walls, in the
course of which undertaking his men felt the vigour of the inhabitants to
a greater extent than he liked. It is said that when he had taken the
town, the municipality received him in state, and supplied him with wine
of the country. He praised the wine very highly, on which one of the body
had the ill <a name="Page_62"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;62]</span></a> taste to assure him that they had a better wine
than that. 'You keep it, perhaps,' was the royal rebuke, 'for a better
occasion.' Henry had a great opinion of this wine; and the Duc de Sully
states, in his Memoirs, that when the Duc de Mayenne retired from the
league against the king, and came to Monceaux to tender his allegiance,
Henry punished him for past offences by walking so fast about the grounds
of the ch&acirc;teau, that the poor duke, what with his sciatica, and what
with his fat, at last told him with an expressive gesture that a minute
more of it would kill him. The king thereupon let him go, and promised him
some <i>vin d'Arbois</i> to set him right again.<a name=
"FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p>The present appearance of the town, as seen from the high level
followed by the railway, scarcely recalls the time when Arbois was known
as <i>le jardin de noblesse</i>, and Barbarossa dated thence his charters,
or Jean Sans-peur held there the States of Burgundy. Gollut<a name=
"FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> tells a story
of a dowager of Arbois, mother-in-law to Philip V. and Charles IV. of
France, which outdoes legend of Bishop Hatto. Mahaut d'Artois was an
elderly lady remarkable for her charities, and was by consequence always
surrounded by large crowds of poor folk during her residence at the
Ch&acirc;telaine, the ruins of which lie a mile or two from Arbois. On the
occasion of a severe famine in Burgundy, she collected a band of her
mendicant friends in a stable, and burned them all, saying that '<i>par
piti&eacute; elle hauoit faict cela, considerant les peines que ces
pauvres debuoient endurer en temps de si grande et tant estrange
famine</i>.'</p>

<a name="Page_63"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;63]</span></a>

<p>There is a Val d'Amour near Arbois, but the more beautiful valley of
that name lies between D&ocirc;le and Besan&ccedil;on, and, as we passed
its neighbourhood, my friend with the Macintosh informed me that as it was
clear from my questions that I was drawing up a history of the Franche
Comt&eacute;, he must beg me to insert a legend respecting the origin of
this name, Val d'Amour, which, he believed, had never appeared in print. I
disclaimed the history, but accepted the legend, and here it is:--The
Seigneur of Chissey was to marry the heiress of a neighbouring seigneurie,
and, it is needless to add, she was very lovely, and he was handsome and
brave. A lake separated the two ch&acirc;teaux, and the young man not
unfrequently returned by water rather late in the evening; and so it fell
out that one night he was drowned. The lady naturally grieved sorely for
her loss, and put in train all possible means for recovering her lover's
body. Time, however, passed on, and no success attended her efforts, till
at length she caused the hills which dammed up the waters to be pierced,
and then De Chissey was found. A village sprang up near the outlet thus
made, and took thence its name Perc&eacute;e, or, as men now spell it,
Parcey; and the rich vegetation which speedily covered the valley, where
once the lake had been, gave it such an air of happiness and beauty, that
the people remembered its origin, and called it the Valley of Love. It is
a fact that Parcy was not always so spelled, for Noble Constantin
Thiehault, Sieur de Perrecey, was a witness to the treaty for the
transference of a miraculous host from Faverney to D&ocirc;le in 1608, and
old maps and books give it as Perrecey and Parrecey indifferently. The De
Chisseys, whose names may be found among the female prebends of
Ch&acirc;teau-Chalon, with its necessary sixteen quarters, filled a
considerable place in the history of the Comt&eacute; from the <a name=
"Page_64"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;64]</span></a> Crusades
downwards, and known as <i>les Fols de Chissey</i>, the brave<a name=
"FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> and dashing,
and witty De Chisseys--qualities which no doubt were possessed by the poor
young man for whom the fair Chatelaine drained the Val d'Amour.</p>

<p>As we drew nearer to Besan&ccedil;on, each turn of the small streams,
and each low rounded hill, might have served as an illustration to
C&aelig;sar's 'Commentaries.' Now at length it was seen how, whatever the
result of a battle, there was always a <i>proximus collis</i> for the
conquered party to retire to; and it would have been easy to find many
suitable scenes for the critical engagement, where the woods sloped down
to a strip of grass-land between their foot and the stream.</p>

<p>The Frenchman knew his C&aelig;sar, but he put that general in the
fourth century B.C. He made mistakes, too, in quoting him, which were
easily detected by a memory bristling with the details of his phraseology,
the indelible result of extracting the principal parts of his verbs, and
the nominatives of his irregular nouns, from half a dozen generations of
small boys. He promised me a rich Julian feast in Besan&ccedil;on, and was
greatly affected when he found that the Englishman could give him
C&aelig;sar's description of his native town. He wholly denied the
amphitheatre with which one of our handbooks has gifted it; and this
denial was afterwards echoed by every one in Besan&ccedil;on, some even
thinking it necessary to explain the difference between an amphitheatre
and an arch of triumph, the latter still existing in the town. The Jesuit
Dunod relates that the amphitheatre was to be seen at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, in the ruined state in which the Alans and Vandals
had left it after their successful siege in 406. It seems to have stood
near the present site of the Madeleine.</p>

<a name="Page_65"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;65]</span></a>

<p>It was a great satisfaction to find that the Frenchman had himself
visited the glaci&egrave;re which was the object of my search, and was
able to give some idea as to the manner of reaching it, for my information
on the subject was confined to a vague notice that there was an ice-cave
five leagues from Besan&ccedil;on. As so often happened in other cases, he
advised me not to go to it, but rather, if I must see a cave, to go to the
Grotto of Ocelles,<a name="FNanchor30"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> a collection of thirty or more caverns
and galleries near the Doubs, below Besan&ccedil;on. Seeing, however, that
I was bent on visiting the glaci&egrave;re, he advised me not to go on
Sunday, for the Cardinal Archbishop had ordered the Trappists at the
Chartreuse near not to receive guests on that day; while Saturday, he
thought, was almost as bad, for nothing better than an omelette could be
obtained on days of abstinence. Saturday, then, was clearly the day to be
chosen.</p>

<p>The first sight of Besan&ccedil;on explains at once why C&aelig;sar was
so anxious to forestall Ariovistus by occupying Vesontio, although the
hill on which the citadel stands is not so striking as the similar hill at
Salins, and the engines of modern warfare would promptly print their
telegrams on every stone and man in the place, from the neighbouring
heights. The French Government has wisely taken warning from the
bombardment by the Allies, and has covered the heights which command it on
either side with friendly fortifications, in which lie the keys of the
place. Historically, Besan&ccedil;on is a place of great interest. It
witnessed the catastrophe of Julius Vindex, who had made terms with <a
name="Page_66"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;66]</span></a> Rufus, the
general sent against him by Nero, but was attacked by the troops of Rufus
before they learned the alliance concluded between the two generals.
Vindex was so much grieved by the slaughter of his troops, and the blow
thus struck, by an unhappy accident, at his designs against the emperor,
that he put himself to death at the gates of the town, while the fight was
still going on.<a name="FNanchor31"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> The Bisuntians claim to themselves the
glory acquired by the Sequani, whose chief city Vesontio was, by the
overthrow of Julius Sabinus, who asserted that he was the grandson of a
son of Julius C&aelig;sar, and proclaimed himself emperor in the time of
Vespasian. The Sequani proceeded against him of their own accord, and
conquered him in the interest of the reigning emperor; and he and his wife
Peponilla lived hid in a tomb for nine years. Here two sons were born to
them; and when they were all discovered and carried to Rome, Peponilla
prettily told the emperor that she had brought up two sons in the tomb, in
order that there might be other voices to intercede for her husband's life
besides her own. They were, however, put to death.<a name=
"FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p>To judge from the style of the hotels, Besan&ccedil;on is not visited
by many English travellers; and yet it well repays a visit, providing
those who care for such things with a full average of vaulted passages,
and feudal gateways, and arcaded court-yards, with much less than the
average of evil smell. There are gates of all shapes and
times--Louis-Quatorze towers, and fortifications specially constructed
under Vauban's own eye; while the approach to the town, from the land
side, is by a tunnel, cut through the live rock which forms a solid chord
to the arc described by the course of the river Doubs. This excavation,
called appropriately the <i>Porte Taill&eacute;e</i>, is attributed by the
various inhabitants to pretty <a name="Page_67"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;67]</span></a> nearly all the famous emperors and kings who
have lived from Julius C&aelig;sar to Louis XIV.: it owes its origin, no
doubt, to the construction of the aqueduct which formerly brought into the
town the waters pouring out of the rock at Arcier, two leagues from
Besan&ccedil;on, and was the work probably of M. Aurelius and L. Verus.
Local antiquaries assign the aqueduct to Agrippa, the son-in-law of
Augustus, apparently for no better reason than because he built a similar
work in Rome. The arch of triumph<a name="FNanchor33"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> at the entrance to the upper town has
been an inexhaustible subject of controversy for many generations of
antiquaries, and up to the time of Dunod was generally attributed to
Aurelian: that historian, however, believed that its sculptures
represented the education of Crispus, the son of Constantine, and that the
name Chrysopolis, by which Besan&ccedil;on was very generally known in
early times, was only a corruption of Crispopolis. Earlier writers are in
favour of the natural derivation of Chrysopolis, and assert that when the
Senones lost their famous chief, the Brennus of Roman history, before
Delphos, they built a town where Byzantium afterwards stood, and called it
Bisantium and Chrysopolis, in memory of their city of those names at
home.</p>

<p>The H&ocirc;tel du Nord is a rambling old house, comfortable after
French ideas of comfort, and rejoicing in an excellent cuisine; though it
is true that on one occasion, at least, <i>haricots verts &agrave;
l'Anglaise</i> meant a mass of fibrous greens, swimming in a most
un-English sea of artificial fat. It is a good place for studying the
natural manners of the untravelled Frenchman, who there sits patiently at
the table, for many minutes before dinner is served, with his napkin
tucked in round his neck, and his countenance composed into a look of much
resignation. <a name="Page_68"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;68]</span></a> The waiters are for the most part shock-headed
boys, in angular-tail coats well up in the back of the neck, who frankly
confess, when any order out of the common run of orders is given, that a
German patois from the left bank of the Rhine is their only extensive
language. One of these won my eternal gratitude by providing a clean fork
at a crisis between the last savouries and the <i>plat doux</i>; for the
usual practice with the waiters, when anyone neglected to secure his knife
and fork for the next course, was to slip the plate from under the
unwonted charge, and leave those instruments sprawling on the tablecloth
in a vengeful mess of gravy. Chickens' bones were there dealt with on all
sides as nature perhaps intended that they should be dealt with, namely,
by taking them between finger and thumb, and removing superfluities with
the teeth; and French officers with wasp-like waists, and red trousers
gathered in plaits to match, boldly despised the sophistication of spoons,
and ate their vanilla cream like men, by the help of bread and fingers.
The manners and broken French of the stranger formed an open and agreeable
subject of conversation, and the table was much quieter than a Frenchman's
<i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> is sometimes known to be: on one occasion,
however, all decorum was scattered to the winds, and the guests rushed out
into the court-yard with disordered bibs and tuckers, on the announcement
by the head waiter of a '<i>chien &agrave; l'Anglaise</i>, not so high as
a mustard-pot,' which one of the company promptly bought for twenty-four
francs, commencing its education on the spot by a lesson in
cigar-smoking.</p>

<p>It frequently happens in France that <i>caf&eacute; noir</i> is a much
more ready and abundant tap than water, and so it was here;
notwithstanding which, the bedroom apparatus was most comfortable and
complete. The chambermaid <a name="Page_69"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;69]</span></a> was a boy, and under his auspices a sheet of
postage-stamps and a lead pencil vanished from the table. When it was
suggested to him that possibly they had been blown into some corner, and
so swept away, he brought a dustpan from a distant part of the house, and
miraculously discovered the stamps perched upon a small handful of dust
therein, deferring the discovery and his consequent surprise till he
reached my room. It was curious that the stamps, which had before been in
an open sheet, were now folded neatly together, and curled into the shape
of a waistcoat-pocket. He was inexorable about the pencil.</p>

<p>No certain information could be obtained in the hotel respecting the
glaci&egrave;re; so an owner of carriages was summoned, and consulted as
to the best means of getting there. He naturally recommended that one of
his own carriages should be taken as far as the Abbey of Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu,
and that we should start at five o'clock the next morning, with a driver
who knew the way to the glaci&egrave;re from the point at which the
carriage must be left.<a name="FNanchor34"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Five o'clock seemed very early for a
drive of fifteen miles; but the man asserted that instead of five leagues
it was a good seven or eight, and so it turned out to be. This
glaci&egrave;re may be called a historical glaci&egrave;re, being the only
one which has attracted general attention; and the mistake about its
distance from Besan&ccedil;on arose very many years ago, and has been
perpetuated by a long series of copyists. The distance may not be more
than five leagues when measured on the map with a ruler; but until the
tunnels and via-ducts necessary for a crow line are constructed, the world
must be content to call it seven and a half at least. The man bargained
for two days' pay for the carriage, on <a name="Page_70"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;70]</span></a> the plea that the horse would be so
tired the next day that he would not be able to do any work, and as that
day was Sunday, the great day for excursions, it would be a dead loss. It
so happened that the charge for two days, fifteen francs, was exactly what
I paid elsewhere for one day, so there was no difficulty about the
price.</p>

<p>We started, accordingly, at five o'clock. The day was delightfully
fine, and in spite of the driver's peculiarity of speech, caused by a
short tongue, and aggravated by a villanous little black pipe clutched
between his remaining teeth, we got through a large amount of question and
answer respecting the country through which we passed. Of course, the
reins were carried through rings low down on the kicking-strap,
ingeniously placed so that each whisk of the horse's tail caught one or
other rein; and then the process of extraction was a somewhat dangerous
one, for there was no splashboard, and the driver had to stow his legs
away out of reach, before commencing operations. The landlord of the inn
at M&uuml;hlinen, on the road from Kandersteg to Thun, has a worse
arrangement than even this, both reins passing through one small leather
loop at the top of the kicking-strap; so that when the horse on one
occasion ran away down a steep hill in consequence of the break refusing
to act, the man in his flurry could not tell which rein to pull, to steer
clear of the wall of rock on one side, and the unfenced slope on the
other, and finally flung himself out in despair, leaving his English cargo

<p>There has evidently been at some time a vast lake near Besan&ccedil;on,
and the old bottom of the lake is now covered with heavy meadow-grass,
while the corn-fields and villages creep down from the higher grounds, on
the remains of promontories which stretch out into the plain. The people
are in constant fear of inundation, and the driver informed me that in <a
name="Page_71"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;71]</span></a> winter
large parts of the plain are flooded, the superfluous waters vanishing
after a time into a great hole, whose powers of digestion he could not
explain. The villages which lie on the shores, as it were, of the lake,
rejoice in church-towers with bulbous domes, rising out of rich clusters
of trees, and the early bells rang out through the crisp air with
something of a Belgian sweetness. Farther on, the road passed through
glorious wheat, clean as on an English model farm, save where some
picturesque farmer had devoted a corner to the growth of poppies. Here, as
elsewhere, potatoes did not grow in ridges, but each root had a little
hillock to itself; an unnatural early training which may account for the
strange appearance of <i>pommes de terre au naturel</i>.</p>

<p>Anyone who has driven through the morning air for an hour or two before
breakfast, will understand the satisfaction with which, about seven
o'clock, we deciphered a complicated milestone into 14 kilom&egrave;tres
from Besan&ccedil;on, which meant breakfast at the next village, Nancray.
The breakfast was simple enough, owing to the absence of butter and other
things, and consisted of coffee in its native pot, and dry bread: the milk
was set on the table in the pan in which it had been boiled, and a
soup-ladle and a French wash-hand basin took the place of cup and spoon. A
cat kept the door against sundry large and tailless dogs, whose appetites
had not gone with their tails; and an old woman kindly delivered a lecture
on the most approved method of making a ptisan from the flowers of the
lime-tree, and on the many medicinal properties of that decoction, to
which she attributed her good health at so advanced an age. I silently
supplemented her peroration by attributing her garrulity to a more
stimulating source.</p>

<p>When we started again, it was time to learn something about the scene
of <a name="Page_72"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;72]</span></a> our
further proceedings, and the driver enunciated his views on monks in
general, <i>&agrave; propos</i> to the Convent of Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu, the
Chartreuse at which we were to leave our carriage, and obtain food for man
and horse. The Brothers, he said, were possessed of many mills, and were
in consequence enormously rich. Among the products of their industry, a
liqueur known as <i>Chartreuse</i> seemed to fill a high place in his
esteem, for he considered it to be better--and he said it as if that
comparative led into an eighth heaven--better even than absinthe. I had an
opportunity of tasting this liqueur some weeks after, a few minutes below
the summit of Mont Blanc, and certainly no one would suspect its great
strength, which is entirely disguised by an innocent and insidious
sweetness, as unlike absinthe as anything can possibly be: impressions,
however, respecting meat and drink, and all other matters, are not very
trustworthy when received near the top of the Calotte. It has lately been
found that the worthy Brothers of the Grande Chartreuse have been
systematically defrauding the revenue, by returning their profits on the
manufacture of this liqueur at something merely nominal as compared with
the real gains. I could not learn whether the ceremony of blessing each
batch of the liqueur, before sending it out to intoxicate the world, is
performed with so much solemnity at Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu as at Grenoble; and,
indeed, it rests only on the assertion of the short-tongued Bisuntian that
the manufacture is carried on at all at the former place.<a name=
"FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Page_73"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;73]</span></a>

<p>Having communicated such information as he possessed, the man seemed to
think he had a right to learn something in return, and administered
various questions respecting customs which he believed to prevail in
England. He evidently did not credit the denial of the truth of what he
had heard, nor yet the assertion, in answer to another question, that
English hothouse grapes are three or four times as large as the ordinary
grapes of France, and well-flavoured in at least a like proportion. The
roadside was planted with apple-trees, and these were overgrown with
mistletoe; so, by way of correcting his idea that the English are a sad
and gloomy people, I informed him of the use made of this parasite by
young people in the country at Christmas-time. Instead, however, of being
thereby impressed with our national liveliness, he looked with a sort of
supercilious contempt upon a people who could require the intervention or
sanction of anything external in such a matter, and turned the
conversation to some more worthy subject.</p>

<p>At length we passed into a pleasant valley, with thrushes singing, and
much chirping of those smaller birds, in the murder of which, sitting,
consists <i>le sport</i> in the eyes of many gentlemen of France. Up to
this point, nothing could have been more unlike the scenery which I had so
far found to be associated with glaci&egrave;res; but now the country
became slightly more Jurane, and limestone precipices on a small scale
rose up <a name="Page_74"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;74]</span></a>
on either hand, decked with the corbel towers which result from the
weathering of the rock. It was the Jura in softer as well as smaller type,
for all the desolate wildness which characterises the more rocky part of
that range was gone, and there were no signs of the grand pine-scenery, or
needle-foliage, as the Germans call it; the trees were all oak and ash and
beech, and the rocks were much more neat and orderly, and of course less
grand, than their contorted kindred farther south. The valley speedily
became very narrow, and a final bend brought us face-to-face with the
buildings of the Abbaye de Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu, striking from their
position--filling, as they do, the breadth of the valley,--but in no way
remarkable architecturally. The journey had been so long that it was now
ten o'clock; and as we were due in Besan&ccedil;on at five in the evening,
we put the horse up as quickly as possible, in a shed provided by the
Brothers, and set off on foot for the glaci&egrave;re, half an hour
distant. About a mile and a half from the convent, the valley comes to an
end, the rocks on the opposite sides approaching so close to each other as
only to leave room for a large flour-mill, belonging to the Brothers, and
for the escape-channel of the stream which works the mill. This building
is quite new, and might almost be taken for a fortification against
inroads by the head of the valley, especially as the words <i>Posuerunt me
custodem</i> appear on the face, applying, however, to an image of the
Virgin, which presides over the establishment. The monks have expended
their superfluous time and energies upon the erection of crosses of all
sizes on every projecting peak and point of rock, one cross more sombre
than the rest marking the scene of a recent death. As I had no means of
determining the elevation of this district above the sea,<a name=
"FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> I made
enquiries as to the climate <a name="Page_75"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;75]</span></a> in winter; and one of the Brothers told me, that
it was an unusual thing with them to have a fall of snow amounting to two
joints of a remarkably dirty finger.</p>

<p>At the mill, the path turns up the steep wooded hill on the right, and
leads through young plantations to a small cottage near the
glaci&egrave;re, where the plantations give place to a well-grown beech
wood. Here my conductor startled me by announcing that there was 20
centimes to pay to the farmer of the cave for entrance; an announcement
which seemed to take all the pleasure out of the expedition, and invested
it with the disagreeable character of sightseeing. The poor driver
thought, no doubt, with some trepidation upon the small amount of <i>
pour-boire</i> he could expect from a monsieur on whom a demand for two
pence produced so serious an effect, and it was difficult to make him
understand that the fact and not the amount of payment was the trouble.
When I illustrated this by saying that I would gladly give a franc to be
allowed to enter the glaci&egrave;re free, he seemed to think that if I
would entrust him with the franc, he might possibly arrange that little
matter for me.</p>

<p>The immediate approach to the glaci&egrave;re is very impressive. The
surface of the ground slopes slightly upwards, and the entrance, from
north to south, is by a broad inclined plane, of gentle fall at first,
which rapidly becomes steep enough to require zigzags. The walls of rock
on either side are very sheer, and increase of course in height as the
plane of entrance falls. The whole length of the slope is about 420 feet,
and down a considerable part of this some grasses and flowers are to be
found: the last 208 feet are covered more or less with ice; though, at the
time of my visit, the furious rains of the end of June, 1864, had washed
down a considerable amount of mud, and so covered some of the ice. There
were no ready means of determining the thickness of <a name="Page_76">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;76]</span></a> this layer of ice, for the
descent of which ten or eleven zigzags had been made by the farmer. In one
place, within 24 feet of its upper commencement, it was from 2-1/2 to 3
feet thick; but the prominence of that part seemed to mark it out as of
more than the average thickness. Even where to all appearance there was
nothing but mud and earth, an unexpected fall or two showed that all was
ice below. Whether the driver had previously experienced the
treacherousness of this slope of ice, or whatever his motive might be, he
left me to enter and explore alone.</p>

<p>The roof of the entrance is at first a mere shell, formed by the thin
crust of rock on which the surface-earth and trees rest high overhead; but
this rapidly becomes thicker, as shown in the section of the cave, and
thus a sort of outer cave is formed, the real portal of the
glaci&egrave;re being reached about 60 feet above the bottom of the slope.
This outer cave presents a curious appearance, from the distinctness with
which the several strata of the limestone are marked, the lower strata
weathered and rounded off like the seats of an amphitheatre of the giants,
and all, up to the shell-like roof, arranged in horizontal semicircles of
various graduated sizes, showing their concavity; while at the bottom of
the whole is seen a patch of darkness, with two masses of ice in its
centre, looming out like grey ghosts at midnight. This darkness is of
course the inner cave, the entrance to which, though it seems so small
from above, is 78 feet broad.</p>

<p>The glaci&egrave;re itself may be said to commence as soon as this
entrance, or perpendicular portal, is passed, and thus includes 60 feet of
the long slope of ice, from the foot of which to the farther end of the
cave is 145 feet, the greatest breadth of the cave being 148 feet.</p>

<br />
 <a name="Page_78"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;78]</span></a>

<p>Immediately below the portal I found a piece of the trunk of a large
column of ice, 7 feet long and 12 feet in girth, its fractured ends giving
the idea of the interior of a quickly-grown tree, in consequence of the
concentric arrangement of convergent prisms described in the account of
the Glaci&egrave;re of S. Georges. The wife of the farmer told me
afterwards that there had been two glorious columns at this portal, which
the recent rains had swept away. Excepting a short space at the foot of
the slope, and another towards the farther end of the cave, the floor was
covered with ice, in some parts from 3 to 4 feet thick: of this a
considerable area had been removed to a depth of 2 1/2 or 3 feet, leaving
a pond of water a foot deep, with bottom and banks of ice. The rock which
composes the true floor rises at the farthest end of the cave, and the
roof is so arranged that a sort of private chapel is there formed; and
from a fissure in the dome a monster column of ice had been constructed on
the floor, which, at the time of my visit, had lost its upper parts, and
stood as a hollow truncated cone with sides a foot thick, and with seas of
ice streaming from it, and covering the rising pavement of the chapel.
Without an axe, and without help, I was unable to measure the girth of
this column, which had not been without companions on a smaller scale in
the immediate neighbourhood. At the west end of the cave, the wall was
thickly covered for a large space with small limestone stalactites,
producing the effect of many tiers of fringe on a shawl; while from a dark
fissure in the roof a large piece of fluted drapery of the same material
hung, calling to mind some of the vastly grander details of the grottoes
of Hans-sur-Lesse in Belgium: down this wall there was also a long row of
icicles, on the edges of a narrow fissure. The north-west corner was very
dark, and an opening in the wall of rock high above the ground suggested a
tantalising cave up <a name="Page_79"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;79]</span></a> there: the ground in this corner was occupied by
the shattered remains of numerous columns of ice, which had originally
covered a circular area between 60 and 70 feet in circumference.</p>

<p>The three large masses of ice which rendered this glaci&egrave;re in
some respects more remarkable than any of those I have seen, lay in a line
from east to west, across the middle of the cave, on that part of the
floor where the ice was thickest. The central mass was extremely solid,
but somewhat unmeaning in shape, being a rough irregular pyramid; its size
alone, however, was sufficient to make it very striking, the girth being
66-1/2 feet at some distance from the ice-floor with which it blended. The
mass which lay to the east of this was very lovely, owing to the good
taste of some one who had found that much ice was wont to accumulate on
that spot, and had accordingly fixed the trunk of a small fir-tree, with
the upper branches complete, to receive the water from the corresponding
fissure in the roof. The consequence was, that, while the actual tree had
vanished from sight under its icy covering, excepting on one side where a
slight investigation betrayed its presence, the mass of ice showed every
possible fantasy of form which a mould so graceful could suggest. At the
base, it was solid, with a circumference of 37 feet. The huge column,
which had collected round the trunk of the fir-tree, branched out at the
top into all varieties of eccentricity and beauty, each twig of the
different boughs becoming, to all appearance, a solid bar of frosted ice,
with graceful curve, affording a point of suspension for complicated
groups of icicles, which streamed down side by side with emulous
loveliness. In some of the recesses of the column, the ice assumed a pale
blue colour; but as a rule it was white and very hard, <a name="Page_80">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;80]</span></a> not so regularly prismatic
as the ice described in former glaci&egrave;res, but palpably crystalline,
showing a structure not unlike granite, with a bold grain, and with a
large predominance of the glittering element. But the westernmost mass was
the grandest and most beautiful of all. It consisted of two lofty heads,
like weeping willows in Carrara marble, with three or four others less
lofty, resembling a family group of lions' heads in a subdued attitude of
grief, richly decked with icy manes. Similar heads seemed to grow out here
and there from the solid sides of the huge mass. The girth was 76 1/2
feet, measured about 2 feet from the floor. When this column was looked at
from the side removed from the entrance to the cave, so that it stood in
the centre of the light which poured down the long slope from the outer
world, the transparency of the ice brought it to pass that the whole
seemed set in a narrow frame of impalpable liquid blue, the effect of
light penetrating through the mass at its extreme edges. The only means of
determining the height of this column was by tying a stone to the end of a
string, and lodging it on the highest head; but this was not an easy
process, as I was naturally anxious not to injure the delicate beauty
which made that head one of the loveliest things conceivable; and each
careful essay with the stone seemed to involve as much responsibility as
taking a shot at a hostile wicket, in a crisis of the game, instead of
returning the ball in the conventional manner. When at last it was safely
lodged, the height proved to be 27 feet. I had hoped to find it much more
than this, from the grandeur of the effect of the whole mass, and I took
the trouble to measure the knotted string again with a tape, to make sure
that there was no mistake. The column formed upon the fir-tree was 3 or 4
feet lower.</p>

<a name="Page_81"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;81]</span></a>

<p>I have since found many notices of this glaci&egrave;re in the Memoirs
of the French Academy and elsewhere, extracts from which will be found in
a later chapter. These accounts are spread over a period of 200 years,
extending from 1590 to 1790, and almost all make mention of the columns or
groups of columns I have described; but, without exception, the heights
given or suggested in the various accounts are much less than those which
I obtained as the result of careful measurement. The latest description of
a visit to the glaci&egrave;re states a fact which probably will be held
to explain, the present excess of height above that of earlier times.<a
name="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> The
citizen Girod-Chantrans, who wrote this description, had procured the
notes of a medical man living in the neighbourhood, from which it seemed
that Dr. Oudot made the experiment, in 1779, of fixing stakes of wood in
the heads of the columns, then from 4 to 5 feet high, and found that these
stakes were the cause of a very large increase in the height of the
columns, ice gathering round them in pillars a foot thick. So that it is
not improbable that the largest of the three masses of the present day
owes its height, and its peculiar form, to a series of stakes fixed from
time to time in the various heads formed under the fissures in the roof,
though nothing but the most solid ice can now be seen. It would be very
interesting to try this experiment in one of the caves where, without any
artificial help, such immense masses of ice are formed; and by this means
columns might, in the course of a year or two, be raised to the very roof.
Further details on this subject will be given hereafter.</p>

<p>There was no perceptible draught of air in any part of the cave, and
the candles burned steadily through the whole time of my visit, which <a
name="Page_82"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;82]</span></a> occupied
more than two hours. The centre was sufficiently lighted by the day; but
in the western corner, and behind the largest column, artificial light was
necessary. The ice itself did not generally show signs of thawing, but the
whole cave was in a state of wetness, which made the process of measuring
and investigating anything but pleasant. I had placed two thermometers at
different points on my first entrance--one on a drawing-board on a large
stone in the middle of the pond of water which has been mentioned, and the
other on a bundle of pencils at the entrance of the end chapel, in a part
of the cave where the ice-floor ceased for a while, and left the stones
and rock bare. The former gave 33&deg;, the latter, till I was on the
point of leaving, 31 1/2&deg;, when it fell suddenly to 31&deg;. It was
impossible, however, to stay any longer for the sake of watching the
thermometer fall lower and lower below the freezing point; indeed, the
results of sundry incautious fathomings of the various pools of water, and
incessant contact of hands and feet with the ice, had already become so
unpleasant, that I was obliged to desert my trusty hundred feet of string,
and leave it lying on the ice, from want of finger-power to roll it up.
The thermometers were both Casella's, but that which registered 31&deg;
was the more lively of the two, the other being mercurial, with a much
thicker stem: the difference in sensitiveness was so great, that when they
were equally exposed to the sun in driving home, the one ran up to 93&deg;
before the other had reached 85&deg;.</p>

<p>In leaving the glaci&egrave;re, I found a little pathway turning off
along the face of the rock on the left hand, a short way up the slope of
entrance, and looking as if it might lead to the opening in the dark wall
on the western side of the cave. After a time, however, it came to a
corner which it seemed an unnecessary risk to attempt to pass alone; and
my <a name="Page_83"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;83]</span></a>
prudence was rewarded by the discovery that, after all, the supposed cave
could not be thus reached. It is said that this other cave was the place
to which the inhabitants fled for refuge when their district was invaded,
probably by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar with his 10,000 Swedes, and that a
ladder 40 feet long is necessary for getting at it.</p>

<p>The driver had long ago absconded when I returned to the upper regions;
but the wife of the farmer of the grotto was there, and communicated all
that she knew of the statistics of the ice annually removed. She said that
in 1863 two chars were loaded every day for two months, each char taking
about 600 kilos, the wholesale price in Besan&ccedil;on being 5 francs the
hundred kilos. Since the quintal contains 50 kilos, it will be seen that
this account does not agree with the statement of Renaud as to the amount
of ice each char could take. No doubt, a char at S. Georges may mean one
thing, and a char in the village of Chaux another; but the difference
between 12 quintaux and 50 or 60 is too great to be thus explained, and
probably Madame Briot made some mistake. Her husband, Louis Briot, works
alone in the cave, and has twelve men and a donkey to carry the ice he
quarries to the village of Chaux, a mile from the glaci&egrave;re, where
it is loaded for conveyance to Besan&ccedil;on. He uses gunpowder for the
flooring of ice, and expects the eighth part of a pound to blow out a
cubic metre; and if, by ill luck, the ice thus procured has stones on the
lower side, he has to saw off the bottom layer. Madame Briot said I was
right in supposing March to be the great time for the formation of ice, as
she had heard her husband say that the columns were higher then than at
any other time of the year: she also confirmed my views as to the
disastrous effects of heavy rain. As with <a name="Page_84"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;84]</span></a> every other glaci&egrave;re of which I
could obtain any account, excepting the Lower Glaci&egrave;re of the
Pr&eacute; de S. Livres, she complained that the ice had not been so
beautiful and so abundant this year as last, although the winter had been
exceptionally severe.</p>

<a name="Page_85"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;85]</span></a>

<h3>BESAN&Ccedil;ON AND D&Ocirc;LE.</h3>

<p>The afternoon was so far advanced when I returned to the convent, that
it was clearly impossible to reach Besan&ccedil;on at five o'clock, and
consequently there was time to inspect the Brothers and their buildings.
The field near the convent was gay with haymakers; and the brown monks,
with here and there a priest in <i>ci-devant</i> white, moved among the
hired labourers, and stirred them up by exhortation and example,--with
this difference, that while it was evidently the business of the monks so
to do, the priests, on the other hand, had only taken fork in hand for the
sake of a little gentle exercise. One unhappy Jacques Bonhomme made hot
and toilsome hay in thick brown clothes, plainly manufactured from a
defunct Brother's gown; for, to judge from appearances, a cast-off gown is
a thing unknown. It was good to see a Brother, in horn spectacles of
medi&aelig;val cut, tenderly chopping a log for firewood, and peering at
it through his spectacles after each stroke, as a man examines some
delicate piece of natural machinery with a microscope; to see another
Brother, the sphere of whose duties lay in the flour-mill, standing in the
doorway with brown robe and shaven crown all powdered alike with white,
and a third covered from head to foot with sawdust; or, best of <a name=
"Page_86"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;86]</span></a> all, to see an
antique Brother, with scarecrow legs, and low shoes which had presumably
been in his possession or that of his predecessors for a long series of
years, wheeling a barrow of liquid manure, with his gown looped up high by
means of stout whipcord and an arrangement of large brass rings. The
Brother whose business it was to do such cooking as might be required by
visitors, grinned in the most friendly and engaging manner from ear to ear
when he was looked at; and, by fixing him steadily with the eye, he could
be kept for considerable spaces of time standing in the middle of the
kitchen, knife in hand, with the corners of his mouth out of sight round
his broad cheeks. His ample front was decked with a blue apron, suspended
from his shoulders, and confined round the convexity of his waist by an
old strap which no respectable costermonger would have used as harness.
The soup served was by courtesy called <i>soupe maigre,</i> but it was in
fact <i>soupe maigre</i> diluted by many homoeopathic myriads, and the
Brother showed much curiosity as to my opinion of its taste--a curiosity
which I could not satisfy without hurting his professional pride. When
that course was finished, the large-faced cook suggested an omelette, as
the most substantial thing allowed on eves, proceeding to draw the
materials from a closet which so fully shared in the general abstinence
from water as a means of cleansing, that I shut my eyes upon all further
operations, and ate the eventual omelette in faith. Its excellence called
forth such hearty commendations, that there seemed to be some danger of
the mouth not coming right again. Then salads, and bread and butter, and
wine, and various kinds of cheese were brought, which made in all a very
fair dinner for a fast-day.</p>

<p>The culinary monk knew nothing of the history of his convent, beyond
the bare year of its foundation, and displayed a monotonous dead level of
<a name="Page_87"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;87]</span></a>
ignorance on all topographical and historical questions: to him the <i>
Pain d'Abbaye</i> <a name="FNanchor38"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> meant nothing further than the staff of
life there provided, and he neither knew himself nor could recommend any
Brother who knew anything about the glaci&egrave;re. He was a German, and
we talked of his native Baiern and the modern glories of his capital; and
when his questions elicited a declaration of my profession, he passed up
to Saxony, and pinned me with Luther. Finding that I objected to being so
pinned, and repudiated something of that which his charge involved, he
waived Luther, of whom he knew nothing beyond his name, and came down upon
me triumphantly with the word Protestant. I explained to him, of course,
that the worthy Elector, and his friends who protested, had not much to do
with the Anglican branch of the Church Catholic; and then the old task had
to be gone through of assuring the assembled Brothers that we in England
have Sacraments, have Orders, have a Trinitarian Creed.</p>

<p>At length, about half-past three, we started for Besan&ccedil;on,
paying of course <i>&agrave; volont&eacute;</i> for food and
entertainment, as we did not choose to qualify as paupers. The driver told
me on the way that there was another glaci&egrave;re at Vaise, a village
three or four kilom&egrave;tres from Besan&ccedil;on, and <a name=
"Page_88"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;88]</span></a> at no great
distance from the road by which we should approach the town; so, when we
reached the crest above Morre, where the road passes the final ridge by
means of a tunnel, I paid the carriage off, and walked to the village of
Vaise. The public-house knew of the glaci&egrave;re--knew indeed of
two,--further still, kept the keys of both. This was good news, though the
idea of keys in connection with an ice-cave was rather strange; and I
proposed to organise an expedition at once to the glaci&egrave;res. The
male half of the auberge declared that he was forbidden to open them to
strangers, except by special order from a certain monsieur in
Besan&ccedil;on; but the female half, scenting centimes, stated her belief
that the monsieur in Besan&ccedil;on could never wish them to turn away a
stranger who had come so many kilom&egrave;tres through the dust to see
the ice. She put the proposed disobedience in so persuasive and Christian
a form, that I was obliged to take the husband's side,--not that he was in
any need of support, for he had been longer married than Adam was, and
showed no signs of giving way. It turned out, after all, that though there
was no doubt about the existence of the glaci&egrave;res, there was
equally no doubt that they were <i>glaci&egrave;res artificielles</i>,
being simply ice-houses dug in the side of a hill, and the property of a
<i>glacier</i> in Besan&ccedil;on; so that my friend the driver had sent
me to a mare's-nest.</p>

<p>The pathway across the hills to Besan&ccedil;on was rather intricate,
and by good fortune an old Frenchman appeared, who was returning from his
work at a neighbouring church, and served as companion and guide. He had
bid farewell to sixty some years before, and, being a builder, had been
going up and down a ladder all day, with full and empty <i>hottes</i>, to
an extent which outdid the Shanars of missionary meetings; and yet he
walked faster than any foreigner of my experience. He talked in due <a
name="Page_89"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;89]</span></a> proportion,
and told some interesting details of the bombardment of Besan&ccedil;on,
which he remembered well. When he learned that I was not German, but
English, he told me they did not say <i>Anglais</i> there, but <i>
Gaudin</i>,--I was a <i>Gaudin</i>. This he repeated persistently many
times, with an air worthy of General Cyrus Choke, and half convinced me
that there was something in it, and that I might after all be a Gaudin. It
was not till some hours after, that I remembered the indelible impression
made by the piety of speech of recent generations of Englishmen upon the
French nation at large, and thus was enabled to trace the origin of the
name <i>Gaudin</i>. The old man evidently believed that it was the proper
thing to call an Englishman by that name; thus reminding me of a story
told of a French soldier in the Austrian service during the long early
wars with Switzerland. The Austrians called the Swiss, in derision,
K&uuml;hmelkers--a term more opprobrious than <i>bouviers</i>; and it is
said that, after the battle of Frastens--one of the battles of the Suabian
war,--a Frenchman threw himself at the feet of some Grisons soldiers, and
innocently prayed thus for quarter; '<i>Tr&egrave;s-chers,
tr&egrave;s-honorables, et tr&egrave;s-dignes K&uuml;hmelkers! au nom de
Dieu, ne me tuez pas</i>!'</p>

<p>The town of Besan&ccedil;on seems to spend its Sunday in fishing, and
is apparently well contented with that very limited success which is wont
to attend a Frenchman's efforts in this branch of <i>le sport</i>. There
is a proverb in the patois of Vaud which says '<i>Kan on vau dau pesson,
s&eacute; fo molli</i>;'<a name="FNanchor39"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and on this the Bisuntians act,
standing patiently half-way up the thigh in the river, as the Swiss on the
Lake of Geneva and other <a name="Page_90"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;90]</span></a> lakes may be seen to do. It is all very well to
wade for a good salmon cast, or to spend some hours in a swift-foot<a
name="FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> Scotch
stream for the sake of a lively basket of trout; but to stand in a Sunday
coat and hat, and 2-1/2 feet of water, watching a large bung hopelessly
unmoved on the surface, is a thing reserved for a Frenchman indulging in a
weekly intoxication of Sabbatical sport, under the delirious form of the
<i>chasse aux goujons</i>.</p>

<p>Clean as the town within the circuit of the river is, the houses which
overhang the water on the other side are picturesque and dirty in the
extreme, story rising above story, and balcony above balcony. It does not
increase their beauty, and to a fastidious nose it must militate against
their eligibility as places of residence, that there is apparently but one
drain, an external one, which follows the course of the pillars supporting
the various balconies: nevertheless, from the opposite side of the river,
and when the wind sets the other way, they are sufficiently attractive. In
this quarter is found the finest church, the Madeleine, with a very
effective piece of sculpture at the east end. The sculpture is arranged on
the bottom and farther side of a sort of cage, which is hung outside the
church, but is visible from the inside through a corresponding opening in
the east wall. The subject of the sculpture is 'The Sepulchre,' and the
ends of the cage or box are composed of rich yellow glass, through which
the external light streams into the cave of the Sepulchre; and when the
church itself is becoming dark, the effect produced by the light from the
evening sky, passing through the deep-toned glass, and softly illuminating
the Sepulchre, is indescribably solemn.</p>

<a name="Page_91"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;91]</span></a>

<p>When Besan&ccedil;on was supplied by the aqueduct with the waters of
Arcier, there was a great abundance of baths, as the remains discovered in
digging new foundations show; but in the present state of the town such
things are not easily met with. The floating baths on the river are
appropriated to the other sex, and the only thing approaching to a male
bath was of a nature entirely new to me, being constructed as
follows:--There is a water-mill in the town, with a low weir stretching
across the river, down which the water rushes with no very great violence.
At the foot of this weir a row of sentry-boxes is placed, approached by
planks, and in these boxes the adventurer finds his bath.<a name=
"FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<div class="centerme"><img alt="BATH IN THE DOUBS, AT BESAN&Ccedil;ON."
src="images/image9.jpg" width="340" height="157" /><br />
 <span class="caption">BATH IN THE DOUBS, AT BESAN&Ccedil;ON.</span></div>

<br />


<p>A stout piece of wood-work is fixed horizontally along the face of the
weir, and has the effect of throwing the downward water out of its natural
direction, and causing it to describe an arch, so that it descends with
much force on to the weir at a point below the wood-work. Here two planks
are placed, forming a seat and a support for the back, and a little lower
still another plank for the feet to rest upon, without which the bather
would have a good chance of being washed away. The water boils noisily and
violently on all sides and in all directions, coming down upon the
subject's shoulders with a heavy thud, <a name="Page_92"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;92]</span></a> which calls to mind the tender years
when something softer than a cane was used, and sends him forth like a
fresh-boiled lobster. All this, with towels, is not dear at fourpence.</p>

<p>The citadel is the great sight of Besan&ccedil;on, and the polite
Colonel-commandant attends at his office at convenient hours to give
passes. What it might be to storm the position under the excitement of the
sport of war, I cannot say; but certainly it is a most trying affair on a
hot Sunday's afternoon, even when all is made smooth, and the gates are
opened, by a comprehensive pass. The wall mentioned by C&aelig;sar as a
great feature of the place cut the site of the citadel off from the town,
and many signs of it were found when the cathedral of S. Stephen was
built, the unfortunate church which went down before the exigencies of a
siege under Louis XIV. The barrack-master proved to be a most interesting
man, knowing many details of C&aelig;sar's life and campaigns which I
suspect were not known to that captain himself. He had served in Algeria,
and assented to the proposition that more soldiers died there of absinthe
than of Arabs, stating his conviction that three-fourths of the whole
deaths are caused by that pernicious extract of wormwood, and that he
ought himself to have died of it long ago. He pointed out the difference
between the massive masonry of the period of the Spanish occupation and
the less impressive work of more recent times, and showed the dungeon from
which Marshal Bourmont bought his escape, in the time of the first
Napoleon.</p>

<p>The floor of one of the little look-out towers is composed of a
tombstone, representing a priest in full ecclesiastical dress, and my
question as to how it came there elicited the following story:--When Louis
XIV. was besieging the citadel, he placed his head-quarters, and a <a
name="Page_93"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;93]</span></a> strong
battery, on the summit of the Mont Chaudane,<a name="FNanchor42"></a><a
href="#Footnote_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> which commands the citadel on one
side as the Br&eacute;gille does on the other. Among the besieged was a
monk named Schmidt, probably one of the Low-country men to whom the
Franche Comt&eacute; was then a sort of home, as forming part of the
dominions of Spain; and this monk was the most active supporter of the
defence, against the large party within the walls which was anxious to
render the town. He was also an admirable shot; and on one of the last
days of the siege, as he stood in the little tower where the tombstone now
lies, the King and his staff rode to the front of the plateau on the Mont
Chaudane to survey the citadel; whereupon some one pointed out to Schmidt
that now he had a fair chance of putting an end at once to the siege and
the invasion. Accordingly, he took a musket from a soldier and aimed at
the King; but before firing he changed his aim, remarking, that he, a
priest, ought not to destroy the life of a man, and so he only killed the
horse, giving the Majesty of France a roll in the mud. When the town was
taken, the King enquired for the man who killed his horse, and asked the
priest whether he could have killed the rider instead, had he wished to do
so. 'Certainly,' Schmidt replied, and related the facts of the case. Louis
informed him, that had he been a soldier, he should have been decorated
for his skill and his impulse of mercy; but, being a priest, he should be
hung. The sentence was carried out, and the priest's body was buried in
the floor of the tower from which he had spared the King's life. If this
be true, it was one of the most unkingly deeds ever done.<a name=
"FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Page_94"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;94]</span></a>

<p>This siege took place in the second invasion or conquest of the Franche
Comt&eacute; by Louis XIV., when Besan&ccedil;on held out for nine days
against Vauban and the King: on the first occasion it had surrendered to
Cond&eacute; after one day's siege, making the single stipulation that the
Holy Shroud should not be removed from the town.<a name=
"FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> The <i>Saincte
Suaire</i> was the richest ecclesiastical treasure of the Bisuntians,
being one of the two most genuine of the many Suaires, the other being
that of Turin, which was supported by Papal Infallibility. Both were
brought from the Crusades; and the one was presented to Besan&ccedil;on in
1206, the other to Turin in 1353. Bede tells a story of the proving of a
Shroud by fire in the eighth century, by one of the caliphs; and as its
dimensions were 8 feet by 4, like that of Besan&ccedil;on, while the
Shroud of Turin measured 12 feet by 3, the people of Besan&ccedil;on
claimed that theirs was the one spoken of by Bede.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of Besan&ccedil;on is no longer S. Stephen, since the
destruction of that church by Louis XIV. The small Church of the Citadel
is now dedicated to that saint, an inscription on the wall stating that it
takes the place of the larger church, <i>ex urbis obsidio anno 1674
lapsae</i>, and offering an indulgence of 100 days for every visit paid to
it, with the sensible proviso <i>una duntaxat vice per diem.</i> Soldiers
not being generally made of the confessing sex, or of confessing material,
there is only one confessional provided for the 6,000 souls which the
citadel can accommodate.</p>

<p>The Cavalry Barracks are in the lower part of the town, and near them
is <a name="Page_95"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;95]</span></a> a
large building with evident traces of ecclesiastical architecture on the
outside. It is, in fact, a very fine church converted into stables,
retaining its interior features in excellent preservation. Under the
corn-bin lies a lady who had two husbands and fifteen children, <i>
Antigone in parentes, Porcia in conjuges, Sempronia in liberos</i>; while
a few yards further east, less agreeably placed, is an ecclesiastic of the
Gorrevod family, who reckoned Prince and Bishop and Baron among his
titles. The nave of this Church of S. Michael accommodates thirty horses,
and the north aisle thirteen; the south is considered more select, and is
boarded off for the decani, in the shape of officers' chargers. The north
side of the chancel gives room for six horses, and the south side for a
row of saddle-blocks. It had been an oversight on the part of the original
architect of the church that no place was prepared for the daily hay; a
fault which the military restorers have remedied by improvising a
lady-chapel, where the hay for the day is placed in the morning. With
Spelman in my mind, I asked if the stables were not unhealthy; but the
soldiers said they were the healthiest in the town.<a name=
"FNanchor45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p>The Glaci&egrave;re of Vaise had proved, as has been seen, to be a
mare's-nest; and yet, after all, it produced a foal; for while I was
endeavouring to overcome the evening heat of Besan&ccedil;on in a <i>
sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;</i> for ice, I found that the owner of the
establishment was also the owner of the two glaci&egrave;res of Vaise; and
in the course of the conversation which followed, he told me of the
existence of a natural glaci&egrave;re near the village of Arc-sous-Cicon,
twenty kilom&egrave;tres from Pontarlier, which he had himself seen. <a
name="Page_96"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;96]</span></a> As I had
arranged to meet my sisters at Neufch&acirc;tel, in two days' time, for
the purpose of visiting a glaci&egrave;re in the Val de Travers, this
piece of information came very opportunely, and I determined to attempt
both glaci&egrave;res with them.</p>

<p>Some of the trains from Besan&ccedil;on stop for an hour at D&ocirc;le
in passing towards Switzerland by way of Pontarlier, and anyone who is
interested in the Burgundian and Spanish wars of France should take this
opportunity of seeing what may be seen of the town of D&ocirc;le and its
massive church-tower. The sieges of D&ocirc;le made it very famous in the
later middle ages, more especially the long siege under Charles d'Amboise,
at the crisis of which that general recommended his soldiers to leave a
few of the people for seed,<a name="FNanchor46"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> and the old sobriquet <i>la Joyeuse</i>
was punningly changed to <i>la Dolente</i>. It has had other claims upon
fame; for if Besan&ccedil;on possessed one of the two most authentic Holy
Shrouds, D&ocirc;le was the resting-place of one of the undoubted
miraculous Hosts, which had withstood the flames in the Abbey of Faverney.
It was for the reception of this Host that the advocates of the
Brotherhood of Monseigneur Saint Yves built the Sainte Chapelle at
D&ocirc;le.<a name="FNanchor47"></a><a href=

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF MONTH&Eacute;ZY, IN THE VAL DE TRAVERS.</h3>

<p>I rejoined my sisters at Neufch&acirc;tel on the 5th of July, and
proceeded thence with them by the line which passes through the Val de
Travers. One of them had been at Fleurier, in 1860, on the day of the
opening of this line, and she added an interest to the various tunnels, by
telling us that a Swiss gentleman of her acquaintance, who had taken a
place in one of the open carriages of the first train, found, on reaching
the daylight after one of the tunnels, that his neighbour had been killed
by a small stone which had fallen on to his head. Where the stone came
from, no one could say, nor yet when it fell, for the unfortunate man had
made no sign or movement of any kind.</p>

<p>Every one must be delighted with the wonders of the line of rail, and
the beauties through which the engineer has cut his way. In valleys on a
less magnificent scale, cuttings and embankments on the face of the hill
are sad eyesores, as in railway-ruined Killiecrankie; but here Nature's
works are so very grand, that the works of man are not offensively
prominent, being overawed by the very facts over which they have
triumphed. When we reached the more even part of the valley, where the
Reuse no longer roars and rushes far below, but winds quietly through the
soft grass on a level with the rail, the whole grouping was so exceedingly
charming, and the river itself so suggestive of lusty trout, <a name=
"Page_98"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;98]</span></a> and the village
of Noiraigue<a name="FNanchor48"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> looked so tempting as it nestled in a
sheltered nook among the headlong precipices, that I registered in a safe
mental pigeon-hole a week at the auberge there with a fishing-rod, and
excursions to the commanding summit in which the <i>Creux de Vent</i> is
found. The engine-driver knew that he was in a region of beauties, and,
when he whistled to warn his passengers that the train was about to move
on, he remained stationary until the long-resounding echoes died out,
floating lingeringly up the valley to neighbouring France.</p>

<p>We had no definite idea as to the <i>locale</i> of the glaci&egrave;re
we were now bent upon attacking. M. Thury's list gave the following
information:--'<i>Glaci&egrave;re de Motiers, Canton de Neufch&acirc;tel,
entre les vall&eacute;es de Travers et de la Br&eacute;vine, pr&egrave;s
du sentier de la Br&eacute;vine</i>;' and this I had rendered somewhat
more precise by a cross-examination of the guard of the train on my way to
Besan&ccedil;on. He had not heard of the glaci&egrave;re, but from what I
told him he was inclined to think that Couvet would be the best station
for our purpose, especially as the 'Ecu' at that place was, in his eyes, a
commendable hostelry. Some one in Geneva, also, had believed that Couvet
was as likely as anything else in the valley; so at Couvet we descended.<a
name="FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p>This is a very clean and cheerful village, devoted to the lucrative
manufacture of <i>absinthe</i>, and producing inhabitants who look like
gentlemen and ladies, and promenade the ways in bonnets and hats, after a
most un-Swiss-like fashion. They carefully restrict themselves to the
making of the poisonous product of their village, and have nothing to do
with the consumption <a name="Page_99"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;99]</span></a> thereof:<a name="FNanchor50"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> hence nature has a fair chance with
them, and they are a healthy and energetic race. The beauties of the
surrounding mountains, with their fitful alternations of pasture and wood,
and grey face of rock, are not marred by the outward appearance, at least,
of that which Bishop Heber lamented in a country where 'every prospect
pleases.' An old lady is commemorated in the annals of Couvet as an
example of the healthiness of the situation, who saw seven generations of
her family, having known her great-grandfather in her early years, and
living to nurse great-grandchildren in her old age. The landlord of the
inn informed us, with much pride, that Couvet was the birthplace of the
man who invented a clock for telling the time at sea; by which, no doubt,
he meant the chronometer, invented by M. Berthoud. At Motiers, the next
village, Rousseau wrote his <i>Lettres de la Montagne</i>, and thence it
was that he fled from popular violence to the island on the Lake of
Bienne.</p>

<p>The 'Ecu' promised us dinner in half an hour, and we strolled about in
the garden of that unsophisticated hotel for an hour and a half,
reconciled to the delay by the beauty of the neighbouring hills, the
winding of the valley giving all the effect of a mountain-locked plain,
with barriers decked with firs. It will readily be conceived, however,
that three practical English people could not be satisfied to feed on
beauty alone for any very great length of time, and we caught the landlady
and became peremptory. She explained that dinner was quite ready, but she
had intended to give us the pleasure of an agreeable society, consisting
of sundry Swiss who were due in another half-hour or so: she yielded,
nevertheless, to our representations, and promised to serve the meal at
once. We were speedily summoned to the <i>salle-&agrave;-manger,</i> and
entered a low smoke-stained wooden chamber, with <a name="Page_100"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;100]</span></a> no floor to speak of, and with
huge beams supporting the roof, dangerous for tall heads. The date on the
door was 1690, and the chamber fully looked its age. There was a long
table of the prevailing hue, with a similar bench; and on the table three
large basins, presumably containing soup, were ranged, each covered with
its plate, and accompanied by a ricketty spoon of yellow metal and a hunch
of black bread. A., who was hungry enough and experienced enough to have
known better, began promptly a most pathetic 'Why surely!' but the
landlady stopped her by opening a side door, and displaying a comfortable
room in which a well-appointed table awaited us:--she had taken us through
the kitchen rather than through the <i>salon</i>, in which were peasants
smoking. We were somewhat disconcerted when we heard that the
unwashed-looking place was the kitchen; but the landlady had made up for
it by scrubbing her husband, who waited upon us, to a high pitch of
presentability, and further experience showed that the 'Ecu' is to be
highly commended for the excellence and abundance and cheapness of its
foods.</p>

<p>There are many natural curiosities in and near the Val de Travers,
which well repay the labour that must be expended upon them. The <i>Temple
des F&eacute;es</i>, on the western side of the Valley of
Verri&egrave;res, used to be called the most beautiful grotto in
Switzerland; and the great Cavern of La Baume, near Motiers, is said to be
exceedingly wonderful. We were shown the entrance to a line of caverns in
the hills above Couvet, and were informed that it was possible to pierce
completely through the range, and pass out at the other side within sight
of Yverdun. One of the caverns in this valley had been explored by some of
A. and M.'s Swiss friends, and the account of what they had gone through
was by no means <a name="Page_101"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;101]</span></a> inviting, seeing that the prevailing material
was damp clay of a solid character, arranged in steep slopes, up which
progression must be made by inserting the fingers and toes as far as might
be into the clay; and, of course, when the handful of unpleasant mud came
away, the result was the reverse of progression. To anyone who has only
known the rope up the pure white side of some snow mountain, the idea of
being roped for the purpose of grappling with underground banks of
adhesive mud and clay must be horrible in the extreme. Another interesting
natural phenomenon is presented by the source of the Reuse, that river
gushing out from the rock in considerable volume, probably formed by the
drainage of the Lake of Etalli&egrave;res, in the distant valley of La
Br&eacute;vine; while the Longe-aigue, on the contrary, is lost in a gulf
of such horror that the people call the mill which stands on its edge the
<i>Moulin d'enfer</i>.</p>

<p>As usual, we were assured that many of these remarkable sights were far
better worth a visit than the glaci&egrave;re, of which no one seemed to
know anything. A guide was at length secured for the next morning, who had
made his way to the cave once in the winter-time and had been unable to
enter it, and we settled down quietly to an evening of perfect rest. The
windows of the bedrooms being guiltless of blinds and curtains, the effect
of waking, in the early morning, to find them blocked up, as it were, by
the green slopes of pasture and the dark bands of fir-woods which clothed
the limiting hills, seemed almost magical, the foreground being occupied
solely by the graceful curve of the dome of the church-tower, glittering
with intercepted rays, and forming a bright omen for the day thus ushered
in.</p>

<p>In due time the promised guide appeared, a sickly boy of
unprepossessing <a name="Page_102"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;102]</span></a> appearance, and of <i>patois</i> to correspond.
I was at first tempted to propose that we should attack him
stereoscopically, A. administering French and I simultaneous German, in
the hope that the combination might convey some meaning to him; but, after
a time, we succeeded with French alone. Perhaps Latin would have made a
more likely <i>m&eacute;lange</i> than German, and to give it him in three
dimensions would not have been a bad plan. The route for the
glaci&egrave;re runs straight up the face of the hill along which the
railway has been constructed; and as we passed through woods of beech and
fir, with fresh green glades rolling down below our feet, or emerged from
the woods to cross large undulating expanses of meadow-land, we were
almost inclined to believe that we had never done so lovely a walk. The
scenery through which we passed was thoroughly that of the lower districts
of the Alps, with nothing Jurane in its character, and the elevation
finally achieved was not very great: indeed, at a short distance from the
glaci&egrave;re, we passed a collection of very neat ch&acirc;lets, with
gardens and garden-flowers, one of the ch&acirc;lets rejoicing in
countless beehives, with three or four 'ekes' apiece. Up to the time of
reaching this little village, which seemed to be called Sagnette, our path
had been that which leads to <i>La Br&eacute;vine</i>, the highest valley
in the canton; but now we turned off abruptly up the steeper face on the
left hand, and in a very few minutes came upon a dry wilderness of rock
and grass, which we at once recognised as 'glaci&egrave;re country;' and
when I told our guide that we must be near the place, he replied by
pointing to the trees round the mouth of the pit.</p>

<p>Shortly after we first left Couvet, a gaunt elderly female, with a
one-bullock char, had joined our party, and tried to bully us into giving
up the cave and going instead to a neighbouring summit, whence she
promised us a view of unrivalled extent and beauty. She told us that <a
name="Page_103"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;103]</span></a> there was
nothing to be seen in the glaci&egrave;re, and that it was a place where
people lost their lives. The guide said that was nonsense; but she reduced
him to silence by quoting a case in point. She said, too, that if a man
slipped and fell, there was nothing to prevent him from going helplessly
down a run of ice into a subterranean watercourse, which would carry him
for two or three leagues underground; and on this head our boy had no
counter-statement to make. She asserted that without ladders it was
utterly impossible to make the descent to the commencement of the
glaci&egrave;re; and she vowed there was no ladder now, nor had been for
some time. Here the boy came in, stating that the cave belonged to a
mademoiselle of Neufch&acirc;tel, who had a summer cottage at no great
distance, and loved to be supplied with ice during her residence in the
country, for which purpose she kept a sound ladder on the spot, and had it
removed in the winter that it might not be destroyed. There was a
circumstantial air about this statement which for the moment got the
better of the old woman; but she speedily recovered herself, and repeated
positively that there was no ladder of any description, adding, somewhat
inconsequently, that it was such a bad one, no Christian could use it with
safety. The boy retorted, that it was all very well for her to run the
glaci&egrave;re down, as she lived near it, but for the world from a
distance it was a most wonderful sight; and, as for the ladder, he
happened to know that it was at this time in excellent preservation. The
event proved that in saying this he drew entirely upon his imagination. It
is, perhaps, only fair to suppose that they don't mean anything by it, and
it may be mere ignorance on their part; but the simple fact is, that some
of those Swiss rustics tell the most barefaced lies
conceivable,--<i>unblushing</i> is an epithet that cannot be safely
applied without previous soap and water,--and tell them in a plodding
systematic <a name="Page_104"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;104]</span></a> manner which takes in all but the experienced
and wary traveller. I have myself learned to suspend my judgment regarding
the most simple thing in nature, until I have other grounds for forming an
opinion than the solemn asseverations of the most stolid and respectable
Swiss, if it so be that money depends upon his report.<a name=

<p>As in the case of two of the glaci&egrave;res already described, the
entrance is by a deep pit, which has the appearance of having been at one
time two pits, one less deep than the other; and the barrier between the
two having been removed by some natural process, a passage is found down
the steep side of the shallower pit, which lands the adventurer on a small
sloping shelf, 21 feet sheer above the surface of the snow in the deeper
pit, the sides of the latter rising up perpendicularly all round. It is
for this last 21 feet that some sort of ladder is absolutely necessary.
Our guide flung himself down in the sun at the outer edge of the pit, and
informed us that as it was cold and dangerous down below, he intended to
go no farther: he had engaged, he said, to guide us to the
glaci&egrave;re, and he felt in no way bound to go into it. He was not
good for much, so I was not sorry to hear of his determination; and when
my sisters saw the sort of place they had to try to scramble down, they
appeared to be very glad that only I was to be with them.</p>

<p>Leaving them to make such arrangements with regard to dress as might
seem necessary to them, I proceeded to pioneer the way down the first part
of the descent. This was extremely unpleasant, for the rocks were steep
and very moist, with treacherous little collections of <a name="Page_105">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;105]</span></a> disintegrated material on
every small ledge where the foot might otherwise have found a hold. These
had to be cleared away before it could be safe for them to descend, and in
other places the broken rock had to be picked out to form foot-holes;
while, lower down, where the final shelf was reached, the abrupt slope of
mud which ended in the sheer fall required considerable reduction, being
far too beguiling in its original form. Here there was also a buttress of
damp earth to be got round, and it was necessary to cut out deep holes for
the hands and feet before even a man could venture upon the attempt with
any comfort. The buttress was not, however, without its advantage, for on
it, overhanging the snow of the lower pit, was a beautiful clump of
cowslips (<i>Primula elatior</i>, Fr. <i>Primev&egrave;re inodore</i>),
which was at once secured as a trophy. The length of the irregular descent
to this point was between 70 and 80 feet. On rounding the buttress, the
upper end of the ladder presented itself, and now the question, between
the boy and the old woman was to be decided. I worked down to the edge of
the shelf, and looked over into the pit, and, alas! the state of the
remaining parts of the ladder was hopeless, owing partly to the decay of
the sidepieces, and partly to the general absence of steps--a somewhat
embarrassing feature under the circumstances. A further investigation
showed that for the 21 feet of ladder there were only seven steps, and
these seven were not arranged as conveniently as they might have been, for
two occurred at the very top, and the other five in a group at the bottom.
A branchless fir-tree had at some time fallen into the pit, and now lay in
partial contact with the ruined ladder; and there were on the trunk
various little knobs, which might possibly be of some use as a supplement
to the rare steps of the ladder. The snow at the bottom of the pit was
surrounded on all sides by <a name="Page_106"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;106]</span></a> perpendicular rock, and on the side opposite to
the ladder I saw an arch at the foot of the rock, apparently 2 or 3 feet
high, leading from the snow into darkness; and that, of course, was the
entrance to the glaci&egrave;re. I succeeded in getting down the ladder,
by help of the supplement, and looked down into the dark hole to see that
it was practicable, and then returned to report progress in the upper
regions. We had brought no alpenstocks to Couvet, so we sent the guide off
into the woods, where we had heard the sound of an axe, to get three stout
sticks from the woodmen; but he returned with such wretched, crooked
little things, that A. went off herself to forage, and, having found an
impromptu cattle-fence, came back with weapons resembling bulbous
hedge-stakes, which she skinned and generally modified with a powerful
clasp-knife, her constant companion. She then cut up the crooked sticks
into <i>b&acirc;tons</i> for a contemplated repair of the ladder, while M.
and I investigated the country near the pit. We found two other pits,
which afterwards proved to communicate with the glaci&egrave;re. We could
approach sufficiently near to one of these to see down to the bottom,
where there was a considerable collection of snow: this pit was completely
sheltered from the sun by trees, and was 66 feet deep and 4 or 5 feet in
diameter. The other was of larger size, but its edge was so treacherous
that we did not venture so near as to see what it contained: its depth was
about 70 feet, and the stone and a foot or two of the string came up wet.
The sides of the main pit, by which we were to enter the glaci&egrave;re,
were, as has been said, very sheer, and on one side we could approach
sufficiently near the edge to drop a plummet down to the snow: the height
of this face of rock was 59 feet, measuring down to the snow, and the
level of the ice was eventually found to be about 4 feet lower. <a name=
"Page_107"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;107]</span></a> Although it
was now not very far from noon, the sun had not yet reached the snow,
owing partly to the depth of the pit as compared with its diameter, and
partly to the trees which grew on several sides close to the edge. One or
two trees of considerable size grew out of the face of rock.</p>

<p>We were now cool enough to attempt the glaci&egrave;re, and I commenced
the descent with A. The precautions already taken made the way tolerably
possible down to the buttress of earth and the shelving ledge, and so far
the warm sun had accompanied us; but beyond the ledge there was nothing
but the broken ladder, and deep shade, and a cold damp atmosphere, which
made the idea, and still more the feel, of snow very much the reverse of
pleasant. A. was not a coward on such occasions, and she had sufficient
confidence in her guide; but it is rather trying for a lady to make the
first step off a slippery slope of mud, on to an apology for a ladder
which only stands up a few inches above the lower edge of the slope, and
so affords no support for the hand: nor, after all, can bravery and trust
quite make up for the want of steps. We were a very long time in
accomplishing the descent, for her feet were always out of her sight,
owing to the shape which female dress assumes when its wearer goes down a
ladder with her face to the front, especially when the ladder has suffered
from ubiquitous compound fracture, and the ragged edges catch the
unaccustomed petticoats. It was quite as well the feet were out of sight,
for some of the supports to which they were guided were not such as would
have commended themselves to her, had she been able to see them. At
length, owing in great measure to the opportune assistance of two of the
batons we had brought down with us for repairs, thanks also to the trunk
of the fir-tree, we reached the snow; and poor A. was planted there,
breaking through the top crust as a commencement of her acquaintance with
it, till such time as I could bring M. down to join her.</p>

<br />
 <a name="Page_109"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;109]</span></a>

<p>The experience acquired in the course of A.'s descent led us to call to
M. that she must get rid of that portion of her attire which gives a shape
to modern dress; for the obstinacy and power of <i>mal-&agrave;-propos</i>
obstructiveness of this garment had wonderfully complicated our
difficulties. She objected that the guide was there; but we assured her
that he was asleep, or if he wasn't it made no matter; so when I reached
the top, she emerged shapeless from a temporary hiding-place, clutching
her long hedge-stake, and feeling, she said--and certainly looking--a good
deal like a gorilla. The most baffling part of the trouble having been
thus got over, we soon joined A., blue already, and shivering on the snow.
The sun now reached very nearly to the bottom of the pit, and I went up
once more for thermometers and other things, leaving a measure with my
sisters, and begging them to amuse themselves by taking the dimensions of
the snow: on my return, however, to the top of the ladder, I found them
combining over a little bottle, and they informed me plaintively that they
had been taking medicinal brandy and snow instead of measurements,--a very
necessary precaution, for anyone to whom brandy is not a greater nuisance
than utter cold. We found the dimensions of the bottom of the pit, i.e. of
the field of snow on which we stood, to be 31-1/2 feet by 21; but we were
unable to form any idea of the depth of the snow, beyond the fact that 'up
to the ancle' was its prevailing condition. The boy told us, when we
rejoined him, that when he and others had attempted to get ice for the
landlord, when it was ordered for him in a serious illness the winter
before, they had found the pit filled to the top with snow.</p>

<p>As we stood at the mouth of the low entrance, making final preparations
for a plunge into the darkness, I perceived a strong cold current blowing
out from the cave--sufficiently strong and cold to render <a name=
"Page_110"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;110]</span></a> knickerbocker
stockings a very unavailing protection. While engaged in the discovery
that this style of dress is not without its drawbacks, I found, to my
surprise, that the direction of the current suddenly changed, and the cold
blast which had before blown out of the cave, now blew almost as strongly
in. The arch of entrance was so low, that the top was about on a level
with my waist; so that our faces and the upper parts of our bodies were
not exposed to the current, and the strangeness of the effect was thus
considerably increased.</p>

<br />
 <span class="caption">GROUND PLAN OF THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF
MONTH&Eacute;ZY. Note: The candle stood at this point.</span></div>

<br />


<p>As a matter of curiosity, we lighted a <i>bougie</i>, and placed it on
the edge of the snow, at the top of the slope of 3 or 4 feet which led
down the surface of the ice, and then stood to watch the effect of the
current on the flame. The experiment proved that the currents alternated,
and, as I fancied, regularly; and in order to determine, if possible, the
law of this alternation, I observed with my watch the <a name="Page_111">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;111]</span></a> exact duration of each
current. For twenty-two seconds the flame of the <i>bougie</i> was blown
away from the entrance, so strongly as to assume a horizontal position,
and almost to leave the wick: then the current ceased, and the flame rose
with a stately air to a vertical position, moving down again steadily till
it became once more horizontal, but now pointing in towards the cave. This
change occupied in all four seconds; and the current inwards lasted--like
the outward current--twenty-two seconds, and then the whole phenomenon was
repeated. The currents kept such good time, that when I stood beyond their
reach, and turned my back, I was enabled to announce each change with
perfect precision. On one occasion, the flame performed its semicircle in
a horizontal instead of a vertical plane, moving round the wick in the
shape of a pea-flower. The day was very still, so that no external winds
could have anything to do with this singular alternation; and, indeed, the
pit was so completely sheltered by its shape, that a storm might have
raged outside without producing any perceptible effect below. It would be
difficult to explain the regularity of these opposite currents, but it is
not so difficult to see that some such oscillation might be expected. It
will be better, however, to defer any suggestions on this point till the
glaci&egrave;re has been more fully described.</p>

<p>We passed down at length through the low archway, and stood on the
floor of ice. As our eyes became accustomed to the darkness, we saw that
an indistinct light streamed into the cave from some low point at a
considerable distance, apparently on a level with the floor; and this we
afterwards found to be the bottom of the larger of the two pits we had
already fathomed, the pit A of the diagram; and we eventually discovered a
similar but much smaller communication with the bottom of the pit B. <a
name="Page_112"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;112]</span></a> In each
of these pits there was a considerable pyramid of snow, whose base was on
a level with the floor of the glaci&egrave;re: the connecting archway in
the case of the pit A was 3 or 4 feet high, allowing us to pass into the
pit and round the pyramid with perfect ease, while that leading to the pit
B was less than a foot high, so that no passage could be forced.</p>

<p>As we stood on the ice at the entrance and peered into the comparative
darkness, we saw by degrees that the glaci&egrave;re consisted of a
continuous sea of smooth ice, sloping down very gently towards the right
hand. The rock which forms the roof of the cave seemed to be almost as
even as the floor, and was from 4 to 5 feet high in the neighbourhood in
which we now found ourselves, gradually approaching the floor towards the
bottom of the pit B, where it became about a foot high, and rising
slightly in that part of the cave where the floor fell, so as to give 9 or
10 feet as the height there. The ice had all the appearance of great
depth; but there were no means of forming a trustworthy opinion on this
point, beyond the fact that I succeeded in lowering a stone to a
considerable depth, in the small crevice which existed between the wall
and the block of ice which formed the floor. The greatest length of the
cave we found to be 112 ft. 7 in., and its breadth 94 ft., the general
shape of the field of ice, which filled it to its utmost edges, being
elliptical. The surface was unpleasantly wet, chiefly in the line of the
currents, which were now seen to pass backwards and forwards between the
pits A and C. In the neighbourhood of the pit B the water stood in a very
thin sheet on the ice, which there was level, and rendered the style of
locomotion necessitated by the near approach of the roof extremely
disagreeable, as I was obliged to lie on my face, and push myself along
the wet and slippery ice, to explore that corner of the cave, being at
length <a name="Page_113"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;113]</span></a>
stopped by want of sufficient height for even that method of
progression.</p>

<p>The circle marked D represents a column from the roof, at the foot of
which we found a small grotto in the ice, which I entered to a depth of 6
feet, the surface of the field of ice showing a very gracefully rounded
fall at the edges of the grotto. At the point E there was a beautiful
collection of fretted columns, white and hard as porcelain, arranged in a
semicircle, with the diameter facing the cave, measuring 22 ft. 9 in.
along this face. On the farther side of these columns there were signs of
a considerable fall in the ice; and by making use of the roots of small
stalagmitic columns of that material, which grew on the slope of ice, I
got down into a little wilderness of spires and flutings, and found a
small cave penetrating a short way under the solid ice-floor. G marks the
place of a free stalagmite of ice, formed under a fissure in the roof; and
each F represents a column from the roof, or from a lateral fissure in the
wall.</p>

<p>The most striking features of this cave were the three domes, marked H
in the ground-plan, in which they ought strictly not to appear, as being
confined to the roof: one of them is shown also in the vertical section of
the cave. They occur where the roof is from 3 to 4 feet above the floor.
It will be understood, that the bent attitude in which we were obliged to
investigate these parts of the cave was exceedingly fatiguing, and we
hailed with delight a sudden circular opening in the roof which enabled us
to stand upright. This delight was immensely increased when our candles
showed us that the walls of this vertical opening were profusely decorated
with the most lovely forms of ice. The first that we came under passed up
out of sight; and in this, two solid cascades of ice hung down, high
overhead, apparently broken off short, <a name="Page_114"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;114]</span></a> or at any rate ending very abruptly:
the others did not pass so far into the roof, and formed domes of very
regular shape. In all three, the details of the ice-decoration were most
lovely, and the effect produced by the whole situation was very curious;
for we stood with our legs exposed to the alternating cold currents, the
remaining part of our bodies being imbedded as it were in the roof; while
the candles in our hands brought out the crystal ornaments of the sides,
flashing fitfully all round us and overhead, when one or other of us moved
a light, as if we had been surrounded by diamonds of every possible size
and setting. One of the domes was so small, that we were obliged to stand
up by turn to examine its beauties; but in the others we all stood
together. On every side were branching clusters of ice in the form of
club-mosses, with here and there varicose veins of clear ice, and
pinnacles of the prismatic structure, with limpid crockets and finials.
The pipes of ice which formed a network on the walls were in some cases so
exquisitely clear, that we could not be sure of their existence without
touching them; and in other cases a sheet 4 or 6 inches thick was found to
be no obstruction to our view of the rock on which it was formed. In one
of the domes we had only one candle, and the bearer of this after a time
contrived to let it fall, leaving us standing with our heads in perfect
darkness; while the indistinct light which strayed about our feet showed
faintly a circle of icicles, hanging from the lower part of the dome, the
fringe, as it were, of our rocky petticoats.</p>

<p>In one of the lower parts of the cave, where darkness prevailed, and
locomotion was only possible on the lowest reptile principles, M.
announced that she could see clear through the ice-floor, as if there were
nothing between her and the rock below. I ventured to doubt this, for
there was an air of immense thickness about the whole ice; and as <a name=
"Page_115"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;115]</span></a> soon as A. and
I had succeeded in grovelling across the intervening space, and converged
upon her, we found that the appearance she had observed was due to a most
perfect reflection of the roof, as shown by the candles we carried, which
may give some idea of the character of the ice. We did not care to study
this effect for any very prolonged time, inasmuch as we were obliged
meanwhile to stow away the length of our legs on a part of the ice which
was thinly covered with water,--one result of its proximity to the arch
communicating with the smallest pit.</p>

<p>It has been said that the whole ice-floor sloped slightly towards one
side of the cave, the slope becoming rather more steep near the edge.<a
name="FNanchor52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Clearly,
ever so slight a slope would be sufficiently embarrassing, when the
surface was so perfectly smooth and slippery; and this added much to the
difficulty of walking in a bent attitude. On coming out of one of the
domes, I tried progression on all-fours--threes, rather, for the candle
occupied one hand,--and I cannot recommend that method, owing to the
impossibility of putting on the break. The pace ultimately acquired is
greater than is pleasant, and the roof is too near the floor to allow of
any successful attempt to bring things to an end by the reassumption of a
biped character.</p>

<p>We placed a thermometer in the line of greatest current, and another in
a still part of the cave. The memorandum is lost of their register--if,
indeed, we ever made one, for we were more concerned with the beauties <a
name="Page_116"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;116]</span></a> than the
temperature was surprisingly high in the line of current, as compared with
the ordinary temperature of ice-caves.</p>

<p>When we came to compare backs, after leaving the cave, we mutually
found that they were in a very disreputable condition. The damp and ragged
roof with which they had been so frequently in contact had produced a
marked effect upon them, and I eventually paid a tailor in Geneva three
francs for restoring my coat to decency. M. took great credit to herself
for having been more careful of her back than the others, and declined to
be laughed at for forgetting that she was only about half as high as they,
to begin with. A. still remembers the green-grey stains, as the most
obstinate she ever had to deal with, especially as her three-days'
knapsack contained no change for that outer part of her dress.</p>

<p>The 'Ecu' gave us a charming dinner on our return; then a moderate
bill, and an affectionate farewell; and we succeeded in catching the early
evening train for Pontarlier.<a name="FNanchor53"></a><a href=

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RE AND NEIGI&Egrave;RE OF ARC-SOUS-CICON.</h3>

<p>The beauties of the Val de Travers end only with the valley itself, at
the head of which a long tunnel ushers the traveller into a tamer
country,--a preparation, as it were, for France. After the border is
passed, the scenery begins to improve again, and the effect of the two
castles of Joux, the new and the old, crowning the heights on either side
of the narrow gorge through which the railway runs, is very fine. The
guide-books inform us that the Ch&acirc;teau of Joux was the place of
imprisonment of the unfortunate Toussaint L'Ouverture, and that there he
died of neglect and cold; and it was in the same strong fortress that
Mirabeau was confined by his father's desire. The old castle, however, is
more interesting from its connection with the history of Charles the Bold,
who retired to La Rivi&egrave;re after the battle of Morat, and spent here
those sad solitary weeks of which Philip de Comines tells with so many
moral reflections; weeks of bodily and mental distress, which left him a
mere wreck, and led to his wild want of generalship and his miserable
death at Nancy. He had melted down the church-bells in this part of
Burgundy and Vaud, to make cannon for the final effort which failed so
fatally at Morat; and the old chroniclers relate--without any allusion to
the sacrilege--that the artillery was wretchedly served on that cruel<a
name="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> day. <a
name="Page_119"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;119]</span></a> It is
some comfort to Englishmen to know that their ancestors under the Duke of
Somerset displayed a marvellous courage on the occasion.</p>

<p>We reached Pontarlier in time for a stroll through the quiet town; but
we searched in vain for the tempting convents and gates, which were marked
on my copy of an old plan of the place, dedicated to the Prince
d'Arenberg, in the well-known times when he governed the Franche
Comt&eacute;. The convents had become for the most part breweries, and the
gates had been improved away. Our enquiries respecting the place of our
destination were fortunately more successful. The idea of a
glaci&egrave;re was new to the world of Pontarlier; but the landlord of
the H&ocirc;tel National had heard of Arc-sous-Cicon, and had no doubt
that we could find a carriage of some sort to take us there. His own
horses were all engaged in haymaking, but his neighbours' horses might be
less busy, and accordingly he took us first to call upon M. Paget, a
friend who added to his income by keeping a horse and voiture for hire.
The Pagets in general had gone to bed, and the door was fastened; but our
guide seemed to know the ways of the house, and we found Madame in the
stables, and arranged with her for a carriage at seven o'clock the next
morning.</p>

<p>At the time appointed, M. Paget did not come, and I was obliged to go
and look him up. He proved to me that it was all right, somehow, and
evidently understood that his convenience, not ours, was the thing to be
consulted. The hotel is in a narrow street, and, apparently on that
account, a stray passer-by was caught, and pressed into M. Paget's service
to help to turn the carriage,--a feat accomplished by a bodily lifting of
the hinder part, with its wheels. After-experience showed that the
narrowness of the street had nothing to with it, and we <a name=
"Page_120"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;120]</span></a> discovered
that the necessity for the manoeuvre was due to a chronic affection of
some portion of the voiture; so that whenever in the course of the day it
became necessary for us to turn round, M. Paget was constrained to call in
foreign help.</p>

<p>The country through which we passed was uninteresting in the extreme,
although we had been told by the landlord that our drive would introduce
us to a succession of natural beauties such as few countries in the world
could show. The line of hills, at the foot of which we expected our route
to lie, looked exceedingly tempting as seen from Pontarlier; but, to our
disappointment, we left the hills and struck across the plain. About ten
or eleven kilom&egrave;tres from Pontarlier, however, the character of the
country changed suddenly, and we found the landlord's promise in some part
fulfilled. Rich meadow-slopes were broken by solitary trees arranged in
Nature's happiest style, and grey precipices of Jurane grimness and
perpendicularity encroached upon the woods and grass. We were coming near
the source of the Loue, M. Paget said, which it would be necessary for us
to visit. He told us that we must leave the carriage at an <i>auberge</i>
on the roadside, and walk to the neighbouring village of Ouhans, which was
inaccessible for voitures, and thence we should easily find our way to the
source. The distance, he declared, was twenty minutes. The woman at the
<i>auberge</i> strongly recommended the source, but did her best to
dissuade us from the glaci&egrave;res, of which she said there were two.
She had visited them herself, and told her husband, who had guided her,
that there was nothing to see. That, we thought, proved nothing against
the glaci&egrave;res, and her dulness of appreciation we were willing to
accept without further proof than her personal appearance. Besides, to go
to the source, and not to Arc, would mean dining with her; so that she was
not an impartial adviser.</p>

<p>M. Paget was <a name="Page_121"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;121]</span></a> a short square man, of very few words, and his
one object in life seemed to be to save his black horse as much as
possible; a very creditable object in itself, so long as he did not go too
far in his endeavours to accomplish it. On the present occasion he
certainly did go too far. The road was quite as good as that which we had
left, and there was no reason in the world why the carriage should not
have taken us to the village. Worse still, we discovered eventually that
the 'twenty minutes' meant twenty minutes from the village to the source,
and represented really something like half the time necessary for that
part of the march, while there was a hot and dusty walk of half an hour
before we reached the village. As he accompanied us in person, we had the
satisfaction of frequently telling him our mind with insular frankness. He
pretended to be much distressed, but assured us each time we returned to
the charge--about every quarter of an hour--that we were close to the
desired spot. From the village to the source, the way led us through such
pleasant scenery and such acceptable strawberries, that we only kept up
our periodical remonstrances on principle, and, after we had wound rapidly
down through a grand defile, and turned a sudden angle of the rock, the
first sight of that which we had come to see amply repaid us all the
trouble we had gone through. The source of the Orbe is sufficiently
striking, but the Loue is by far more grand at the moment of its birth.
The former is a bright fairy-like stream, gushing out of a small cavern at
the foot of a lofty precipice clothed with clinging trees; but the Loue
flows out from the bottom of an amphitheatrical rock much more lofty and
unbroken. The stream itself is broader and deeper, and glides with an
infinitely more majestic calmness from a vast archway in the rock, into
the recesses of which the eye can penetrate to the <a name="Page_122">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;122]</span></a> point where the roof
closes in upon the water, and so cuts off all further view. The calmness
of the flow may be in part attributed to a weir, which has been built
across the stream at the mouth of the cave, for the purpose of driving a
portion of the water into a channel which conveys it to various
mill-wheels; for, at a very short distance below the weir, the natural
stream makes a fall of 17 feet, so that, if left to itself, it might
probably rush out more impetuously from its mysterious cavern. The weir is
a single timber, below the surface, fixed obliquely across the stream on a
shelving bank of masonry, and the farther end meets the wall of rock
inside the cave. Near it we saw some glorious hart's-tongue ferns, which
excited our desires, and I took off boots and stockings, and endeavoured
to make my way along the weir; but the face of the masonry was so very
slippery, and the nails in the timber so unpleasant for bare feet, and the
stream was so unexpectedly strong, that I called to mind the proverbial
definition of the better part of valour, and came back without having
achieved the ferns. The biting coldness of the water, and the boiling of
the fall close below the weir, did not add to my confidence in making the
attempt, but I should think that in a more favourable state of the water
the cave might be very well explored by two men going alone. The day
penetrated so completely into the farthest corners, that when I got
half-way along the weir, I could detect the oily look on the surface where
it first saw the light, which showed where the water was quietly streaming
up from its unknown sources. The people in the neighbourhood were unable
to suggest any lake or lakes of which this river might be the subterranean
drainage. It is liable to sudden and violent overflows, which seldom last
more than twenty-four hours; and from the destruction of property caused
by these outbursts, the name of <i>La Loue</i>, sc. <i>La Louve</i>, has
<a name="Page_123"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;123]</span></a> been
given to it. The rocky valley through which the river runs, after leaving
its underground channel, is exceedingly fine, and we wandered along the
precipices on one side, enjoying the varying scenes so much that we could
scarcely bring ourselves to turn; each bend of the fretting river showing
a narrow gorge in the rock, with a black rapid, and a foaming fall. It is
said that although the mills on the Doubs are sometimes stopped from want
of water, those which derive their motive power from this strange and
impressive cavern have never known the supply to fail.</p>

<p>Before we started for our ramble among the woods and precipices which
overhang the farther course of the Loue, we had sent off M. Paget to the
<i>auberge</i>, with strict orders that he should at once get out the
black horse, and bring the carriage to meet us at Ouhans, as one of us was
not in so good order for walking as usual, and the day was fast slipping
away. Of course we saw nothing of him when we reached Ouhans; and as it
was not prudent to wait for his arrival there, which might never take
place, we walked through the broiling sun in the direction of the <i>
auberge,</i> and at last saw him coming, pretending to whip his horse as
if he were in earnest about the pace. We somewhat sullenly assisted him to
turn the old carriage round, and then bade him drive as hard as he could
to Arc-sous-Cicon, still a long way off. This he said he would do if he
knew which was the way; but since he was last there, as a much younger
man, there had been a general change in the matter of roads, and how the
new ones lay he did not know. This was not cheerful intelligence,
especially as we had set our hearts upon getting back to Pontarlier in
time for the evening train, which would give us a night at the charming
<i>Bellevue</i> at Neufch&acirc;tel, instead of the poisonous coffee and
the trying odours of the <i>National</i>: the old man's instinct, <a name=
"Page_124"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;124]</span></a> however, led
him right, and we reached Arc at half-past twelve. One obstacle to our
journey on the new road promised at first to be insurmountable, being an
immense <i>sapin</i>, the largest I have seen felled, which lay on a
combination of wood-chairs straight across the road. It had been brought
down a narrow side-road through a wheat-field, and one end occupied this
road, while the other was jammed against the wall on the opposite side of
the main road; and half-a-dozen men, with as many draught oxen, were
mainly endeavouring to turn it in the right direction. M. Paget knew how
much was required to turn his own carriage, and he calculated that the
road would not be free for two or three hours, which involved a rest for
his black horse, a pipe for himself, and, possibly, a short sleep. The
oxen were lazy, and their hides impervious; the whips were cracked in
vain, and in vain were brought more directly to bear upon the senses of
the recusants; the men howled, and rattled the chains, and re-arranged the
clumsy head-gear, but all to no purpose. The man who did most of the
howling was a black Burgundian dwarf, in a long blouse and moustaches; and
he did it in so frightful a patois, that the oxen were right in their
refusal to understand. We represented to M. Paget that it would be
possible to make our way through the wheat; but he declared himself
perfectly happy where he was, and declined to take any steps in the
matter; whereupon I assumed the command of the expedition, and led the
horse through the corn, thus turning the flank of the <i>sapin</i> and its
attendants. Our driver submitted to this act of violence much as a member
of the Society of Friends allows a chamberlain to remove his hat from
behind when he is favoured with an audience of the sovereign; and when we
regained the high road, he meekly took up the reins and drove us at a good
pace to Arc.</p>

<p>The village lies in a curiously open plain, with a girdle of hills, in
<a name="Page_125"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;125]</span></a> one of
which the glaci&egrave;res were supposed to lie. The first <i>auberge</i>
refused us admittance, on the ground that the dinner was all pre-engaged,
and the result was that we found a pleasanter place higher up the village,
near a vast new <i>maison de ville</i> with every window shattered by
recent hail. The people groaned over the unnecessary expense of this huge
building, which might well, from its size, have been a home for the whole
village; and they told us that the communal forests had been terribly
over-cut to provide the money for it. Our first demand was for food; our
next, for a guide to the glaci&egrave;res. Food we could have; but why <i>
should</i> we wish to go to the glaci&egrave;res, when there was so much
else worth seeing at a little distance?--a guide might without doubt be
found, but there was nothing to be seen when we got there. We ordered
prompt dinner, anything that happened to be ready, and desired the
landlord to look out for a man to show us the way up the hills. When the
dinner came, it was cold; and the main dish consisted apparently of
something which had made stock for many generations of soup, and had then
been kept in a half-warm state, ready to be heated for any passer-by who
called for hot meat, till the cook had despaired of its ever being used,
and had allowed it to become cold: at least, no other supposition seemed
to account for its utter want of flavour, and the wonderful development of
its fibres. As a matter of politeness, I asked the man what it was; when
he took the dish from the table, smelled at it, and pronounced it
veal.</p>

<p>There were also several specimens of the original old turnip-radish,
with large shrubs of heads, and mature feelers many inches long. As all
this was not very inviting, we ordered an omelette and some cheese; and
when the omelette came, we found that the cook had combined our ideas and
understood our order to mean a cheese-omelette, which was not so bad <a
name="Page_126"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;126]</span></a> after
all.</p>

<p>By this time, the landlord's visit to his drinking-room had procured a
man willing to act as our guide. He was, unfortunately, more willing than
able; for his sojourn in the drinking-room had told upon his powers of
equilibrium. He asserted, as every one seemed in all cases to assert, that
neither rope nor axe was in any way necessary. When I pressed the rope, he
said that if monsieur was afraid he had better not go; so we told the
landlord privately that the man was rather too drunk for a guide, and we
must have another. The landlord thereupon offered himself, at the
suggestion of his wife, who seemed to be the chief partner in the firm,
and we were glad to accept his offer; while the incapacitated man whom we
had rejected acquiesced in the new arrangement with a bow so little
withering, and with such genuine politeness, that, in spite of his
over-much wine, he won my heart. The landlord himself did not profess to
know the glaci&egrave;res; but he knew the man who lived nearest to them,
and proposed to lead us to his friend's ch&acirc;let, whence we should
doubtless be able to find a guide.</p>

<p>We stole a few moments for an inspection of the Church of Arc, and
found, to our surprise, some very pleasing paintings in good repair, and
open sittings which looked unusually clean and neat. Then we crossed the
plain towards the north, and proceeded to grapple with a stiff path
through the woods which climb the first hills. It turned out that there
was no one available for our purpose in the ch&acirc;let to which the
landlord led us; but a small child was despatched in search of the master
or the domestic, and returned before long with the latter individual, who
received the mistress's instruction respecting the route, and received
also an axe which I had begged in case of need. The accounts we had heard
of the glaci&egrave;re or glaci&egrave;res--every one declined to call
them <a name="Page_127"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;127]</span></a>
caves--were so various, and the total denials of their existence so many,
that we quietly made up our minds to disappointment, and agreed that what
we had seen at the source of the Loue was quite sufficient to repay us for
the trouble we had taken; while the idea of a rapid raid into France had
something attractive in it, which more than counterbalanced the old charms
of Soleure. Besides, we found that we were now in a good district for
flowers, and the abundant <i>Gnaphalium sylvaticum</i> brought back to our
minds many a delightful scramble in glacier regions, where its lovely
velvet kinsman the <i>pied-de-lion</i> grows. On the broad top of the
range of hills, covered with rich grass, we came upon large patches of a
plant, with scented leaves and pungent seeds, which we had not known
before, <i>Meum athamanticum</i>, and, to please our guide, we went
through the form of pretending that we rather liked its taste. My sisters
were in ecstasies of triumph over a wild everlasting-pea, which grew here
to a considerable height--<i>Lathyrus sylvestris</i>, they said, Fr. <i>
Gesse sauvage</i>, distinct from <i>G. h&eacute;t&eacute;ropyhlle,</i>
which is still larger, and is almost confined to a favourite place of
sojourn with us, the little Swiss valley of Les Plans. It is said that on
the top of these hills springs of water rise to the surface, though there
is no higher ground in the neighbourhood; a phenomenon which has been
accounted for by the supposition of a difference of specific gravity
between these springs and the waters which drive them up.</p>

<p>The character of the ground on the plateau changed suddenly, and we
passed at one step, apparently, from a meadow of flowers to a wilderness
of fissured rock, lying white and skeleton-like in the afternoon sun. We
only skirted this rock in the first instance, and made for a clump of
trees some little way off, in which we found a deep pit, with a path of <a
name="Page_128"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;128]</span></a>
sufficient steepness leading to the bottom. Here we came to a collection
of snow, much sheltered by overhanging rocks and trees; and this, our
guide told us, was the <i>neigi&egrave;re</i>, a word evidently formed on
the same principle as <i>glaci&egrave;re</i>. The snow was half-covered
with leaves, and was unpleasantly wet to our feet, so that we did not
spend much time on it, or rather in it. A huge fragment of rock had at
some time or other fallen from overhead, and now occupied a large part of
the sloping bottom of the pit: by squeezing myself through a narrow
crevice between this and the live rock, which looked as if it ought to
lead to something, I found a veritable ice-cave, unhappily free from
ornament, and of very small size, like a round soldier's tent in shape,
with walls of rock and floor of ice. We afterwards found an easier
entrance to the cave; but the floor was so wet, and the constant drops of
water from the roof so little agreeable, that we got out again as soon as
possible, especially as this was not the glaci&egrave;re we had come to
see.</p>

<p>When we reached the surface once more, the landlord and the domestic
both assured us that the <i>neigi&egrave;re</i> was the great sight, the
glaci&egrave;re being nothing at all, but, such as it was, they would lead
us to it. They took us to the fissured rock mentioned above; and when we
looked down into the fissures, we saw that some of them were filled at the
bottom with ice. They were not the ordinary fissures, like the crevasses
of a glacier, but rather disconnected slits in the surface, opening into
larger chambers in the heart of the rock, where the ice lay. In one part
of this curious district the surface sank considerably, and showed nothing
but a tumbled collection of large stones and rocks, piled in a most
disorderly manner. By examining the neighbourhood of the larger of these
rocks, we found a burrow, down which one of the men and I made our way,
and thus, after some windings in the interior, reached a point from <a
name="Page_129"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;129]</span></a> which we
could descend to the ice. The impression conveyed to my mind by the whole
appearance of the rock and ice was not unlike that of the domes in the
Glaci&egrave;re of Month&eacute;zy; only that now the lower part of the
dome was filled with ice, and we stood in the upper part. There were two
or three of these domes, communicating one with another, and in all I
found abundant signs of the prismatic structure, though no columns or
wall-decoration remained. My sisters were accomplished in the art of
burrowing, but they did not care to come down, and we soon rejoined them,
spending a little time in letting down lighted <i>bougies</i> into the
various domes and fissures, in order to study the movements of the air,
but our experiments did not lead to much.</p>

<p>The landlord had evidently not believed in the existence of ice in
summer, and his first thought was to take some home to his wife, to prove
that we had reached the glaci&egrave;re and had found ice: such at least
were the reasons he gave, but evidently his soul was imbued with a deep
obedience to that better half, and the offering of a block of ice was
suggested by a complication of feelings. When we reached the <i>
auberge</i> again, we found the rejected guide still there, and more
unstable than before. The general impression on his mind seemed to be that
he had been wronged, and had forgiven us. In our absence he had been
meditating upon the glaci&egrave;re, and his imagination had brought him
to a very exalted idea of its wonders. Whereas, in the former part of the
day, he had stoutly asserted that no cord could possibly be necessary, he
now vehemently affirmed that if I had but taken him as guide, he would
have let me down into holes 40 m&egrave;tres deep, where I should have
seen such things as man had never seen before. Had monsieur seen the
source of the Loue? Yes, monsieur had. Very fine, was it not? Yes, very
fine. Which did monsieur <a name="Page_130"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;130]</span></a> then prefer--the glaci&egrave;re, or the
source? The source, infinitely. <i>Then</i> it was clear monsieur had not
seen the glaci&egrave;re:--he was sure before that monsieur had not, <i>
now</i> it was quite clear, for in all the world there was nothing like
that glaci&egrave;re. The Loue!--one might rather see the glaci&egrave;re
once, than live by the source of the Loue all the days of one's life.</p>

<p>It was now five o'clock, and the train left Pontarlier at half-past
seven. We represented to M. Paget that he really ought to do the twenty
kilom&egrave;tres in two hours and a quarter, which would leave us a
quarter of an hour to arrange our knapsacks and pay the <i>National</i>.
He promised to do his best, and certainly the black horse proved himself a
most willing beast. There was one long hill which damped our spirits, and
made us give up the idea of catching the train; and here our driver came
to the rescue with what sounded at first like a promising story--the only
one we extracted from him all through the day--<i>&agrave; propos</i> of a
memorial-stone on the road-side, where a man had lately been killed by two
bears; but, when we came to examine into it, the romance vanished, for the
man was a brewer's waggoner with a dray of beer, and the bears were tame
bears, led in a string, which frightened the brewer's horses, and so the
man was killed. Contrary to our expectations and fears, we did catch the
train, and arrived in a thankful frame of mind at comfortable quarters in
Neufch&acirc;tel.</p>

<h3>THE SCHAFLOCH, OR TROU-AUX-MOUTONS, NEAR THE LAKE OF THUN.</h3>

<p>The next morning, my sisters went one way and I another; they to a
valley in the south-west of Vaud, where our head-quarters were to be
established for some weeks, and I to Soleure, where a Swiss <i>savant</i>
had vaguely told us he believed there was a glaci&egrave;re to be seen.
That town, however, denied the existence of any approach to such a thing,
with a unanimity which in itself was suspicious, and with a want of
imagination which I had not expected to find. One man I really thought
might be persuaded to know of some cave where there was or might be ice,
but after a quarter of an hour's discussion he finally became immovable on
the negative side. A Frenchman would certainly have been polite enough to
accommodate facts to my desires. It was all the more annoying, because the
Weissenstein stood overhead so engagingly, and I should have been only too
glad to spend the night in the hotel there, if anyone had given me the
slightest encouragement. I specially pointed at the neighbourhood of this
hotel to my doubtful friend, as being likely for caves; but he was not in
the pay of the landlord, and so failed to take the hint. There is a
curious hole in which ice is found near Weissenstein in Carniola,<a name=
"FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> and it is not
impossible that this may have originated the idea of a glaci&egrave;re
near Soleure.</p>

<a name="Page_132"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;132]</span></a>

<p>The Schweizerhof at Berne is a very comfortable resting-place; but, in
spite of its various excellences, if a tired traveller is told that No. 53
is to be his room, he will do well to seek a bed elsewhere. No. 53 is a
sort of closet to some other number, with a single window opening low on
to the passage, and is adjudged to the unfortunate individual who arrives
at that omnipresent crisis which raises the charge for bed-rooms, and
silences all objections to their want of comfort--namely, when there is
only one bed left in the house. In itself, No. 53 would be well enough;
but the throne of the chambermaid is in the passage, by the side of the
window, and the male attendant on that particular stage naturally
gravitates to the same point, when the bells of the stage do not summon
him elsewhere, and often enough when they do. This combination leads of
course to local disturbances of a somewhat noisy character, and however
entirely a sleepy man may in principle sympathise with the causes of the
noise, it becomes rather hard to bear after midnight. The precise actors
on the present occasion have, no doubt, quarrelled or set up a <i>
caf&eacute;</i> before now, or perhaps have achieved both results by
taking the latter first; but there is reason to believe that so long as
the window of No. 53 is the seat of the chambermaid for the time being, so
long will that room be--as the landlord neatly expressed it when a protest
was made--<i>etwas unruhig</i>.</p>

<p>All Switzerland has been playing at soldiers for some time, and as we
left Berne the next morning, we saw three or four hundred Federal men of
war marching down the road which runs parallel with the rails. The three
officers at the head of the column were elderly and stout; moreover, they
were mounted, and that fact was evidently due rather to the meekness of
their chargers than to the grip of their own legs. When they <a name=
"Page_133"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;133]</span></a> saw the train
coming, they took prompt measures. They halted the troops, and rode off
down a side lane to be out of harm's way; and when we had well passed,
they rejoined the column, and the march was resumed.</p>

<p>The early train from Berne catches the first boat on the Lake of Thun,
and I landed at the second station on the lake, the village of Gonten or
Gunten. M. Thury's list states that the glaci&egrave;re known as the
Schafloch is on the Rothhorn, in the Canton of Berne, 4,500 m&egrave;tres
of horizontal distance from Merligen, a village on the shore of the lake;
and from these data I was to find the cave. Gonten was apparently the
nearest station to Merligen, and as soon as the small boat which meets the
steamer had deposited me on the shore, I asked my way, first to the <i>
auberge</i>, and then to Merligen. The <i>auberge</i> was soon found, and
coffee and bread were at once ordered for breakfast; but when the people
learned my eventual destination, they would not let me go to Merligen. A
man, to whom--for no particular reason--I had given two-pence, called a
council of the village upon me, and they proceeded to determine whether I
must have a guide from Gonten, or only from a nameless ch&acirc;let higher
up. The discussion was noisy, and was conducted without words: they do not
speak, those men of Gonten--they merely grunt, and each interprets the
grunts as he wills. My two-penny friend told me what it all meant, in an
obliging manner, but in words less intelligible than the grunts; and one
member of the council drew out so elaborate a route--the very characters
being wild patois--splitting the morning into quarter-stundes and
half-quarter-stundes, with a sharp turn to the right or left at the end of
each, that, as I drank my coffee, I determined to take a guide from the
village, whatever the decision of the council might be. <a name=
"Page_134"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;134]</span></a> Fortunately,
things took a right turn, and when breakfast was finished, a deputation
went out and found a guide, suspiciously like one of their number who did
not return, and I was informed that Christian Opliger would conduct me to
the Schafloch for five francs, and a <i>Trinkgeld</i> if I were satisfied
with him. In order to prove to me that he had really been at the cave, six
days before, with two Bernese gentlemen, he seized my favourite
low-crowned white hat, and endeavoured to knead it into the shape of the
cave.</p>

<p>Our affairs took a long time to arrange, for grunts and pantomime are
not rapid means of communication, when it comes to detail. The great
question in Christian's mind seemed to be, what should we take with us to
eat and drink? and when he propounded this to me with steady pertinacity,
I, with equal pertinacity, had only one answer--a cord and a hatchet. At
last he provided these, vowing that they were ridiculously unnecessary,
but comprehending that they must be forthcoming, as a preliminary to
anything more digestible; and then I told him, some dry bread and no wine.
This drove him from grunts to words. No wine! it would be so frightfully
hot on the mountains!--I told him I never drank wine when I was hot. But
it would be so terribly cold in the cave!--I never drank wine when I was
cold. But the climbing was <i>sehr stark</i>--we should need to give
ourselves strength!--I never needed to give myself strength. There was no
good water to be found the whole way!--I never drank water. Then, at last,
after a brief grunt with the landlord, he struck:--he simply would not go
without wine! I never wished him to do so, I explained; he might take as
much as he chose, and I would pay for it, but he need not count me for
anything in calculating how much was necessary. This made him perfectly
happy; and when I answered his question touching cheese in a similar
manner, only limiting him to a <a name="Page_135"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;135]</span></a> pound and a half, he rushed off for a large
wicker <i>hotte</i>, spacious enough for the stowage of many layers of
babies; and in it he packed all our properties, and all his provisions.
The landlord had made his own calculations, and put it at 3lbs. of bread
and 2lbs. of cheese; but I cut down the bread on account of its bulk,
before I saw the size of the <i>hotte</i>, and Christian seemed to think
he had quite enough to carry.</p>

<p>It was about half-past nine when we started from the <i>auberge</i>;
and after a short mount in the full sun, we were not sorry to reach the
pleasant shade of walnut trees which accompanied us for a considerable
distance. The blue lake lay at our feet on the right, and beyond it the
Niesen stood, with wonted grandeur, guarding its subject valleys; more in
front, as we ascended transversely, the well-known snow-peaks of the
Bernese Oberland glittered high above the nearer foreground, and, sheer
above us, on the left, rose the ragged precipices whose flank we were to
turn. The Rothhorn of the Canton Berne lies inland from the Lake of Thun,
and sends down towards the lake a ridge sufficiently lofty, terminating in
the Ralligst&ouml;cke, or Ralligflue, the needle-like point, so prettily
ridged with firs, which advances its precipitous sides to the water. These
precipices were formed in historic times, and the sheer face from which
half a mountain has been torn stands now as clear and fresh as ever, while
a chaos of vast blocks at its foot gives a point to the local legends of
devastation and ruin caused by the various berg-falls. Two such falls are
clearly marked by the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>: one of these, a hundred and
fifty years ago, reduced the town of Ralligen to a solitary Schloss; and
the other, in 1856, overwhelmed the village of Merligen, and converted its
rich pastures into a desert cropped with stones. A traveller in
Switzerland, at the beginning of this century, <a name="Page_136"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;136]</span></a> found that the inhabitants of
Merligen were considered in the neighbourhood to be <i>d'une
stupidit&eacute; et d'une b&ecirc;tise extr&ecirc;mes</i>, and I am
inclined to believe that after the last avalanche a general migration to
Gonten must have taken place.</p>

<p>Christian's patois was of so hopeless a description, that I was tempted
to give it up in despair, and walk on in silence. Still, as we were
together for a whole long day, for better or for worse, it seemed worth
while to make every effort to understand each other, else I could learn no
local tales and legends, and Christian would earn but little <i>
Trinkgeld</i>; so we struggled manfully against our difficulties. A
confident American lady, meditating Europe, and knowing little French and
no German, is said to have remarked jauntily that if the worst came to the
worst she could always talk on her fingers to the peasants; but I did not
attempt to avail myself of the results of early practice in that universal
language. Christian's answers--the more intelligible parts of them--were a
stratified succession of <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>, and as he was a man
naturally polite and acquiescent, the assentient strata were of more
frequent occurrence; but of course, beyond showing his good-will, such
answers were of no practical value. At length, after long perseverance, we
were rewarded by the appearance of a curiosity which eventually gave each
the key to the other's cipher. This was a strong stream of water, flowing
out of the trunk of a growing tree, at a height of six feet or so from the
ground; and I was so evidently interested in the phenomenon, that
Christian exerted himself to the utmost, at last with success, to explain
the construction of the fountain. A healthy poplar, seven or eight years
old, is taken from its native soil, and a cold iron borer is run up the
heart of the trunk from the roots, for six feet or more, by which means
the pith is removed, and the trunk is made to assume the <a name=
"Page_137"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;137]</span></a> character of a
pipe. A hole is then bored through from the outside of the trunk, to
communicate with the highest point reached by the former operation, and in
this second hole a spout is fixed. The same is done at a very short
distance above the root, in the part of the trunk which will be buried in
the earth when the tree is replanted, and the poplar is then fixed in damp
ground, with the pipe at its root in connection with one of the little
runs of water which abound in meadows at the foot of hills. A well-known
property of fluids produces then the strange effect of an unceasing flow
of water from an iron spout in the trunk of a living tree; and, as poplars
love water, the fountain-tree thrives, and is more vigorous than its
neighbours. This sort of fountain may be common in some parts of
Switzerland, but I have not seen them myself except in this immediate
neighbourhood. There is said to be one near Stachelberg.</p>

<p>In the endeavour to explain all this to me, Christian succeeded so
perfectly, that for the rest of the day we understood each other very
well. When I told him that he spoke much better German than the rest of
the people in Gonten, he informed me that he had worked among foreigners,
in proof whereof he held out his fingers; but all that I could gather from
the invited inspection was, that, whatever his employment might have been,
he could not be said to have come out of it with clean hands. He had been
employed, he explained, in German dye-works, and there had learned
something better than the native patois. About this time, too, I was able
to make him understand that, as he carried more than I, he must call a
halt whenever he felt so inclined; upon which he patted me affectionately
on the back, and, if I could remember the word he used, I believe that I
should now know the Swiss-German for a brick.</p>

<p>Our object was to pass along the side of the lake, at a considerable <a
name="Page_138"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;138]</span></a>
elevation, till we reached the east side of the Rothhorn range, when we
were to turn up the J&uuml;stisthal, and mount towards the highest point
of the ridge, the glaci&egrave;re lying about an hour below the summit, in
the face of the steep rock. The cliffs became very grand on either side,
as soon as we entered this valley, the J&uuml;stisthal, especially the
precipices of the Beatenberg on the right; and our path lay through woods
which have sprung up on the site of an early <i>Berg-lauine.</i> The
guide-books call attention to a cavern with a curious intermittent spring
in this neighbourhood. English tourists should feel some interest in the
Cave of S. Beatus, inasmuch as its canonised occupant went from our shores
to preach the Gospel to the wild men of the district, and died in this
cave at a very advanced age. His relics remaining there, his
f&ecirc;te-day attracted such crowds of pilgrims, that reforming Berne
sent two deputies in 1528 to carry off the saint's skull, and bury it
between the lakes; but still the pilgrimages continued, and at length the
Protestant zeal of Berne went to the expense of a wall, and they built the
pilgrims out in 1566. S. Beatus is said to have been converted by S.
Barnabas in Britain, and to have gone to Rome, whence S. Peter sent him
out to preach. His relics were conveyed to Lucerne in 1554, because heresy
prevailed in the country where his cave lies, and an arm is among the
proud possessions of pilgrim-pressed Einsiedeln. The saint was originally
a British noble, by name Suetonius; and Dempster drops a letter from his
name, and with much ingenuity makes him collateral ancestor of a Scottish
family--'The Setons, tall and proud.'<a name="FNanchor56"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p>When we arrived at the last ch&acirc;let, Christian turned to mount the
grass <a name="Page_139"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;139]</span></a>
slope on our left hand, which led to the part of the rocks in which the
entrance to the Schafloch was to be sought. I never climbed up grass so
steep, and before we had gone very far we were hailed by a succession of
grunts, which my companion interpreted into assurances from some invisible
person that we were going wrong. The man soon appeared, in the shape of a
charcoal-burner, and told us that we were making the ascent much more
difficult than it need be made, and also, that we should come to some
awkward rock-climbing by the route we had chosen. It was too late,
however, to turn back; so we persevered.</p>

<p>Before long, I heard a <i>Meinherr</i>! from Christian, in a tone which
I knew meant rest and some food. He explained that he would rather take
two small refreshments, one here and one at the Schafloch, than one large
refreshment at the cave; so we propped ourselves on the grass, and tapped
the <i>hotte</i>. The cheese proved to be delightful--six years old, the
landlady told us afterwards, and apparently as hard as a bone, but when
once mastered its flavour was admirable. Christian persuaded me to taste
the wine, of which he had a high opinion, and he was electrified by the
universal shudder the one taste caused. The grapes from which it was
brewed had been grown in a gooseberry garden, and all the saccharine
matter carefully extracted; the wine had been left without a cork since
the first dawn of its existence, and the heat and jolting of its travels
on Christian's back had reduced it to the condition of warm flat <a name=
"Page_140"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;140]</span></a> vinegar. He
drank it with the utmost relish, and was evidently reconciled to my
verdict by the consideration that there would be all the more for him.</p>

<p>From the appearance of the bread and cheese when the meal had come to
an end, I concluded that my companion had changed his mind in the course
of feeding, and had resolved to compress the whole eating of the day into
one large refreshment here. The consumptive powers of the Swiss-German
peasant, when his meal is franked, has not unfrequently reminded me of the
miraculous eating performed by a yellow domino of that nation, at the
f&ecirc;te by which Louis XIV. celebrated the second marriage of the
Dauphin. This domino was of large size, and ate and drank voraciously
throughout the entertainment, which lasted many hours, retiring every five
minutes or so, and returning speedily with unabated appetite. The thing
became at length so portentous, that enquiries were instituted, and it was
found that the trusty <i>Cent-Suisses</i> had joined at a domino, and were
drawing lots all through the evening for the next turn at eating; so that
each man's time was necessarily limited, and he accordingly made the most
of it.</p>

<p>We soon took to the rocks, and found them, as the charcoal-burner had
promised, sufficiently stiff work. Colonel (now General) Dufour visited
the Schafloch with a party of officers in 1822, and he describes<a name=
"FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> the path as a
dangerous one, so much so that several of the gallant members of his party
could not reach the cave: he uses rather large words about the precipices,
and it is a matter of observation that military service on the Continent
tends to induce a habit of body which is not the most suitable for
doubtful climbing. The mountain seemed to be composed, in <a name=
"Page_141"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;141]</span></a> this part, of
horizontal layers of crumbling shale, with a layer now and then of stone,
about the thickness of an ordinary house-tile. The stone layers project
from the looser masonry, and afford an excellent foot-hold; but a slip
might be unpleasant. Every one who has done even a small amount of
climbing has met with an abundance of places where 'a slip would be
certain death,' as people are so fond of saying; but equally he has
discovered that a slip is the last thing he thinks of making in such
situations. Christian had told me that if I had the slightest tendency to
<i>Schwindelkopf</i>, I must not go by the improvised route; but it proved
that there were really no precipices at all, much less any of sufficient
magnitude to turn an ordinary head dizzy. He chose these rocks as the text
for a long sermon on the necessity for great caution when we should arrive
at the cave, telling of an Englishman who had tried to visit it two years
before, and had cut his knee so badly with his guide's axe that he had to
be carried down the mountain to Gonten, and thence to the steamer for
Thun, in which town he lay for many weeks in the hands of the German
doctor; this last assertion being by no means incredible. Also, of a
native who attempted the cave alone, and, making one false step near the
top of a fall of ice, slipped down and down almost for ever, and finally
landed with broken limbs on a floor of ice, where he was found, two days
after, frozen stiff, but still alive.</p>

<p>It was not necessary to mount much, for we were almost as high as the
mouth of the cave, according to Christian's belief, and our work consisted
chiefly in passing along the face of the rock, round projecting buttresses
and re-entering angles, till we reached that part of the mountain where we
might expect to find our glaci&egrave;re. While we were thus engaged, two
hoarse and ominous ravens took us under their charge, and accompanied us
with unpleasant screams, which argued the <a name="Page_142"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;142]</span></a> proximity of food or nest. We soon
found that we had disturbed their meal, for we came to marks of blood, and
saw that some animal had slipped on the rocks above, and landed on the
ledge on which we were walking, bounding off again on to a shelf below,
where the ravens had already torn the body to pieces. I must confess to a
very considerable shudder when we discovered the reason of their screams,
and neither of us seemed to enjoy the circling and croaking of the unclean
birds.</p>

<p>Very soon after this, Christian announced that we had reached the cave,
and a steep little climb of six feet or so brought us to the entrance.
Here we were haunted still by the presence of pieces of the fallen goat,
which lay about here and there on the ground; and the flutter of wings
overhead explained to us that the old ravens had built their nest in the
mouth of the cave, and had brought morsels of raw flesh to their young
ones, which were scarcely able to fly. I am ashamed to say that we were so
angry with the old birds for shrieking so suggestively in our ears, and
parading before us the results of a slip on the rocks, that we charged
ourselves with stones, and put an end to the most noisy member of the foul
brood; Christian making some of the worst shots it is possible to
conceive, and raining blocks of stone and lumps of wood in all directions,
with such reckless impartiality, that the only safe place seemed to be
between him and the bird. One of us, at least, regretted the useless
cruelty as soon as it was perpetrated, and it came back upon me very
reproachfully at an awkward part of our return journey.</p>

<p>The Schafloch does not take its name from the bones contained in it, as
is the case with the K&uuml;hloch in Franconia,<a name="FNanchor58"></a><a
href="#Footnote_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> but from the fact that <a name=
"Page_143"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;143]</span></a> when a sudden
storm comes on, the sheep and goats make their way to the cave for
shelter, never, I was told, going so far as the commencement of the ice.
The entrance faces ESE., and is of large size, with a low wall built
partly across it to increase the shelter for the sheep: Dufour calls the
entrance 50 feet wide and 25 feet high, but I found the width at the
narrowest part, a few yards within the entrance, to be 33 feet.<a name=
"FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> For a short
distance the cave passes horizontally into the rock, in a westerly
direction, and is quite light; it then turns sharp to the south, the floor
beginning to fall, and candles becoming necessary. Here the height
increases considerably, and the way lies over a wild confusion of loose
masses of rock, which have apparently fallen from the roof, and make
progression very difficult. We soon reached a point where ice began to
appear among the stones; and as we advanced it became more and more
prominent, till at length we lost sight of the rock, and stood on solid
ice.</p>

<p>On either side of the cave was a grand column of ice forming the
portal, as it were, through which we must pass to further beauties. The
ice-floor rose to meet these columns in a graceful swelling curve,
perfectly continuous, so that the general effect was that of two columns
whose roots expanded and met in the middle of the cave; and, indeed, that
may have been really the order of formation. The right-hand column was
larger than its fellow, but, owing to the more gradual expansion of the
lower part of its height, and the steepness of the consequent slope, we
were unable to measure its girth at any point where it could be fairly
called a column.<a name="Page_144"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;144]</span></a> Christian had been in the cave a few
days before, and he assured me that the swelling base of this column had
increased very considerably since his last visit, pointing out a solid
surface of ice, at one part of our track, where he had before walked on
bare rock. The cave was by no means extremely cold, that is to say, it was
rather above than below the freezing point, and the splashing of drops of
water was audible on all sides; so that, if Christian spoke the truth,--it
was sad to be so often reminded of Legree's plaintive soliloquy in the
opening pages of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,'--the explanation, I suppose, might
be that the drops of water, falling on the top of the column or
stalagmite, run down the sides, and carry with them some melted portion
from the upper part of the column, and after a course of a few yards
become so far refrigerated as to form ice.<a name="FNanchor60"></a><a
href="#Footnote_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> The pillar on the left was more
approachable, but we were unable to determine its dimensions; for on the
outer side, where it stood a few feet or yards clear of the side of the
cave, the rounded ice at its foot fell off at once into a dark chasm, a
sort of smooth enticing <i>Bergschrund</i>, which we did not care to face.
Christian declared that this column was not so high as it was a day or two
before, which may go to support the theory expressed above, or at least
that part of it which depends upon the supposition of water dropping on to
the head of the column, and melting certain portions of it.</p>

<p>If we were unable to take the external dimensions of this column, I had
no doubt that we should find internal investigations interesting; so, to
Christian's surprise, I began to chop a hole in it, about two feet from
the ground, and, having made an entrance sufficiently large, proceeded to
get into the cavity which presented itself.<a name="Page_145"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;145]</span></a> The flooring of the dome-shaped
grotto in which I found myself, was loose rock, at a level about two feet
below the surface of the ice-floor on which Christian still stood. The
dome itself was not high enough to allow me to stand upright, and from the
roof, principally from the central part, a complex mass of delicate
icicles passed down to the floor, leaving a narrow burrowing passage
round, which was itself invaded by icicles from the lower part of the
sloping roof, and by stubborn stalagmites of ice rising from the floor.<a
name="FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> The
details of this central cluster of icicles, and in fact of every portion
of the interior of the strange grotto, were exceedingly lovely, and I
crushed with much regret, on hands and knees, through fair crystal forests
and frozen dreams of beauty. In making the tour of this grotto, contorting
my body like a snake to get in and out among the ice-pillars, and do as
little damage as might be, but yet, with all my care, accompanied by the
incessant shiver and clatter of breaking and falling ice, I came to a hole
in the ground, too dark and deep for one candle to show its depth; so I
called to Christian to come in, thinking that two candles might show it
better. He asked if I really meant it, and assured me he could be of no
use; but I told him that he must come, and informed him that he, being the
smaller man, would find the passage quite easy. It was very fortunate that
I had not waited a minute longer before summoning him, for just as he had
dropped into the hollow, and was beginning his journey to the side where I
now was, a drop of water and a simultaneous icicle came upon my candle,
and left me in darkness, curled up like a dormouse in a nest of ice, at
the edge of the newly discovered shaft; <a name="Page_146"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;146]</span></a> while my troubles were brought to a
climax by an incursion of icy drops, which had me at their mercy. If all
this had happened while Christian was still outside, he would probably
have staid there wringing his hands till it was time to go home, and I
should certainly not have liked to move without a light. As it was, I did
not inform him of the catastrophe, but let him come toiling on, wondering
audibly what madness could drive Herrschaft into such places; and when he
arrived, we cut off the wet wick, and lighted the candle again. We could
make nothing of the hole, so he returned by the way he had come, and I
completed the tour of the grotto, finding the same difficult passage, and
the same ice beauties, all the way round.</p>

<p>Having squeezed ourselves out again through the narrow hole, we now
passed between the two gigantic columns, and found that the sea of ice
became still broader and bolder. I much regret that I neglected to take
any measurements in this part of the cave; but farther down, where it was
certainly not so broad, I found the width of the ice to be 75 feet. It was
throughout of the crystalline character which prevails in all the large
masses in the glaci&egrave;res I have visited. For some distance beyond
the columns, we found neither stalactites nor stalagmites--indeed, I
forgot to look at the roof--until we came to the edge of a glorious
ice-fall, down which Christian said it was impossible to go--no one had
ever been farther than where we now stood. I have seen no subterranean
ice-fall so grand as this, round and smooth, and perfectly unbroken,
passing down, like the rapids of some river too deep for its surface to be
disturbed, into darkness against which two candles prevailed nothing. The
fall in the Upper Glaci&egrave;re of the Pr&eacute; de S. Livres was
strange enough, but it was very small, and led to a confined corner of the
<a name="Page_147"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;147]</span></a>
cavern; whereas this of the Schafloch rolls down majestically, cold and
grey, into a dark gulf of which we could see neither the roof nor the end,
while the pieces of ice which we despatched down the steep slope could be
heard going on and on, as M. Soret says, <i>&agrave; une
tr&egrave;s-grande distance</i>. The shape, also, of the fall was very
striking. Beginning at the left wall of the cave, the edge ran out
obliquely towards the middle, when it suddenly turned and struck straight
across to the right-hand wall, so that we were able to stand on a tongue,
as it were, in the middle of the top of the fall. To add to the effect,
precisely from this tongue or angle a fine column of ice sprang out of the
very crest of the fall, rising to or towards the roof, and to this we
clung to peer down into the darkness.</p>

<p>The rope we had brought was not long, and the idea was hopeless of
cutting steps down this great fall, leading we knew not where, with an
incline which it frightened Christian even to look at. I began to
consider, however, whether it was not possible to make our way down the
left branch of the ice, which fell rather towards the side wall than into
the dark gulf below. On examining more closely, I found that a large
stone, or piece of rock, projected from the face of this branch of the
fall, about 12 feet from the top, and to this I determined to descend, as
a preliminary to further attempts, the candles not showing us what there
was beyond. Accordingly, I tied on the rope, and planted Christian where
he had a safe footing, telling him to hold tight if I slipped, for he
seemed to have little idea what the rope was meant for. The ice was very
hard, and cutting steps downwards with a short axe is not easy work; so
when I came within 3 or 4 feet of the rock, I forgot the rope, and set off
for a short glissade. Christian, of course, thought something was wrong,
and very properly put a prompt strain upon the rope, which reduced his
Herr to a spread-eagle sort of condition, in <a name="Page_148"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;148]</span></a> which it was difficult to
explain matters, so as to procure a release. When that was accomplished, I
saw it would be easy to reach the point where the ice met the wall, so I
called to Christian to come down, which he did in an unpremeditated,
avalanche fashion; and then, by cutting steps here and there, and making
use of odd points of rock, we skirted down the edge of the great fall, and
reached at last the lower regions.</p>

<p>When I came to read Dufour's account of his visit in 1822, I found that
the ice must have increased very much since his time. He uses sufficiently
large words, speaking of the <i>vaste, horrible et pourtant
magnifique</i>--of the <i>horreur du s&eacute;jour</i>, and the <i>
grandeur des demeures souterraines</i>; but he only calls the glorious
ice-fall a <i>plan inclin&eacute;</i>, and says that the whole was less
remarkable for the amount of ice, than for the characteristics indicated
by the words I have quoted. He says that it required <i>une assez forte
dose de courage</i> to slip down to the stone of which I have spoken; the
fact being that at the time of my visit it would have been impossible to
do so with any chance of stopping oneself, for the flat surface of the
stone was all but even with the ice. M. Soret, who saw the cave in 1860,
determined that cords were then absolutely necessary for the descent,
which he did not attempt; and the only Englishman I have met who has seen
this cave, tells me that he and his party went no farther than the edge of
the fall.<a name="FNanchor62"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> Probably each year's accumulation on
the upper floor of ice has added to the height and rapidity of the fall;
but at any rate, when Dufour was there, <i>des militaires</i>--as he
dashingly tells--were not to be stopped, and he and his party--such of
them as had not been already stopped by the precipices outside--let
themselves slip down to the stone, and thence descended as we did.</p>

<a name="Page_149"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;149]</span></a>

<p>We soon found that the larger ice-fall looked extremely grand when seen
from below, and that in a modified form it reached far down into the lower
cave, and terminated in a level sea of ice; but, before making any further
investigations into its size, we pressed on to look for the end of the
cave. This soon appeared, and as a commentary on Christian's assertion
that no one had ever been beyond the head of the fall, I called his
attention to some initials smoked on the wall by means of a torch. There
was an abrupt piece of rock-floor between this end and the termination of
the ice. The western wall was ornamented with a long arcade of lofty
columns of very white ice, looking strangely ghostlike by the light of two
candles, crystallised, and with the porcelain appearance I have described
before. We could not measure the height of these columns, but we found
that they extended continuously, so as to be in fact one sheet of columns,
connected by shapes of ice now graceful and now grotesque, for 27 yards.
The ice from their feet flowed down to join the terminal lake, which
formed a weird sea 28 yards by 14. My notes, written on the spot, tell me
that between this lake, which I have called terminal, and the end of the
cave, there is a sheet of ice 48 yards long, but it has entirely vanished
from my recollection.</p>

<p>I now sent Christian back with a ball of string, up the steps we had
cut for the descent, with directions to get as near as he could to the top
of the main fall, and then send down a stone tied to the string, as I
wished to determine the length of the fall. While he was making his way
up, I amused myself by chopping and carving at the ice at various points
to examine its structure, until at length a <i>Jodel</i> from above
announced that Christian had reached his post; and a vast amount of
hammering ensued, of which I could not understand the meaning. Presently
he called out that 'it' was coming, and assuredly it did come. There was
<a name="Page_150"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;150]</span></a> a loud
crash on the upper part of the fall, and a shower of fragments of ice came
whizzing past, and almost dislodged me; while the sound of pieces of ice
bounding and gliding down the slope seemed as if it never would cease. It
turned out to mean that my friend had not been able to find a stone; so he
had smashed a block of ice from the column which presided over the fall,
and having attached the string to this, had hurled the whole apparatus in
my direction, fortunately not doing as much damage as he might have done.
My end of the string was not to be seen, so he repeated the experiment,
with a piece of wood in place of the block of ice, and this time it
succeeded. We found that from top to bottom of the fall was 45 yards.
There was all the appearance of immense thickness, especially towards the
upper part.</p>

<p>Christian had placed his candle in a niche in the column, while he
arranged the string for measuring the fall, and the effect of the spark of
light at the top of the long steep slope was extremely strange from below.
The whole scene was so remarkable, that it required some effort to realise
the fact that I was not in a dream. Christian stood at the top invisible,
jodeling in a most unearthly manner, and developing an astonishing
falsetto power, only interrupting his performance to assure me that he was
not coming down again; so I was obliged to measure the breadth of the fall
by myself. I chose a part where the ice was not very steep, and where
occasional points of rock would save some of the labour of cutting steps;
but even so it was a sufficiently tedious business. The string was always
catching at something, and mere progression, without any string to manage,
would have been difficult enough under the circumstances. It was
completely dark, so a candle occupied one hand, and, as every step must be
cut, save where an opportune rock or stone <a name="Page_151"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;151]</span></a> appeared, an axe occupied the other;
then there was the string to be attended to, and both hands must be ready
to clutch at some projecting point when a slip came, and now and then a
ruder rock required circumvention. Add to all this, that hands and feet
had not been rendered more serviceable by an hour and a half of contact
with ice, and it will easily be understood that I was glad when the
measurement was over. At this point the breadth was 25 yards, and, a few
feet above the line in which I crossed, all traces of rock or stone
disappeared, and there was nothing but unbroken ice. I had of course
abundant opportunities for examining the structure of the ice, and I found
in all parts of the fall the same large-grained material, breaking up,
when cut, into the usual prismatic nuts.</p>

<p>I now rejoined Christian, and we worked our way upwards to the mouth of
the cave, penitently desisting from stoning a remaining raven. We observed
at the very mouth, by watching the flame of the candles, a slight current
outwards, extremely feeble, and on our first arrival I had fancied there
was a current, equally slight, inwards, but neither was perceptible beyond
the entrance of the cave. M. Soret was fortunate enough to witness a
curious phenomenon, at the time of his visit to the Schafloch, in
September 1860, which throws some light upon the atmospheric state of the
cave. The day was externally very foggy, and the fog had penetrated into
the cavern; but as soon as M. Soret began to descend to the
glaci&egrave;re itself, properly so called, he passed down out of the fog,
and found the air for the rest of the way perfectly clear.<a name=

<p>M. Soret states that he has not absolute confidence in his <a name=
"Page_152"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;152]</span></a> thermometrical
observations, but as he had more time than I to devote to such details,
inasmuch as he did not pass down into the lowest part of the cave, I give
his results rather than my own, which were carelessly made on this
occasion:--On a stone near the first column of ice, 0&deg;&middot;37 C.;
on a stick propped against the column on the edge of the great ice-fall,
2&deg;&middot;37 C.; in a hole in the ice, filled with water by drops from
the roof, 0&deg; C. approximately.<a name="FNanchor64"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> The second result is sufficiently
remarkable. My own observations would give nearer 33&deg; F. than 32&deg;
as the general temperature of the cave.</p>

<p>Christian was so cold when we had finished our investigations, that he
determined to take his second refreshment <i>en route</i>, and, moreover,
time was getting rather short. We had started from Gonten at half-past
nine in the morning, and reached the glaci&egrave;re about half-past
twelve. It was now three o'clock, and the boat from Gonten must reach the
steamer at half-past six precisely, so there was not too much time for us;
especially as we were to return by a more mountainous route, which
involved further climbing towards the summit of the Rothhorn, and was to
include a visit to the top of the Ralligflue. On emerging from the cave,
we were much struck by the beauty of the view, the upper half of the
Jungfrau, with its glittering attendants and rivals, soaring above a rich
and varied foreground not unworthy of so glorious a termination. There was
not time, however, to admire it as it deserved, and we set off almost at
once up the rocks, soon reaching a more elevated table-land by dint of
steep climbing. The ground of this table-land was solid rock, smoothed and
rounded by long weathering, and fissured in every direction by broad and
narrow crevasses 2 or 3 feet deep, at the bottom of which <a name=
"Page_153"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;153]</span></a> was luxuriant
botany, in the shape of ferns, and mallows, and monkshood, and all manner
of herbs. The learned in such matters call these rock-fallows <i>
Karrenfelden</i>. When we had crossed this plateau, and came to grass, we
found a gorgeous carpet of the huge couched blue gentian (<i>G.
acaulis</i>, Fr. <i>Gentiane sans tige</i>), with smaller patterns put in
by the dazzling blue of the delicate little flower of the same species
(<i>G. verna</i> ); while the white blossoms of the grass of Parnassus,
and the frailer white of the <i>dryade &agrave; huit petales</i>, and the
modest waxen flowers of the <i>Azalea procumbens</i> and the <i>airelle
ponctu&eacute;e</i> (<i>Vaccineum vitis idaea</i>), tempered and set off
the prevailing blue. There were groves, too, rather lower down, of Alpine
roses (the first I had come across that year), not the fringed or the
green-backed species which botanists love best, but the honest old
rust-backed rhododendron, which every Swiss traveller has been pestered
with in places where the children are one short step above mere mendicity,
but, equally, which every Swiss traveller hails with Medean delight when
he comes upon it on the mountain-side. We were now, too, in the
neighbourhood of the first created Alpen rose. The story is, that a young
peasant, who had climbed the precipices behind Oberhausen for
rock-flowrets, as the price of some maiden's love, fell at the moment when
he had secured the flowers, and was killed. From his blood the true Alpen
rose sprang, and took its colour.</p>

<p>We were now passing along the summit of one of the lower spurs of the
Rothhorn range, and making for the peak of the Ralligflue, which lay
considerably below us. In descending near the line of crest, we found a
large number of very deep fissures, narrow and black, some of them
extending to a great distance across the face of the hill; sometimes they
appeared as mere holes, down which we despatched stones, sometimes as
unpleasant crevasses almost hidden by flowers and the shrubs of <a name=
"Page_154"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;154]</span></a> rhododendron.
In many of these we dimly discovered accumulated snow at the bottom, and
we observed that the Alpine roses which overhung the snow-holes were by
far the deepest coloured and most beautiful we could find.</p>

<p>To reach the Ralligflue, we had to cross a smooth green lawn completely
covered with the sweet vanilla orchis (<i>O. nigra</i>), which perfumed
the air almost too powerfully. No one can ever fully appreciate the
grandeur of the lion-like Niesen till he has seen it from this verdant
little paradise, on the slope near the Bergli Ch&acirc;let, with a
diminutive limpid lake in the meadow at his feet, and the blue lake of
Thun below. The Kanderthal and the Simmenthal lie exposed from their
entrance at the foot of the Niesen; and when the winding Kanderthal is
lost, the Adelbodenthal takes up the telescope, and guides the eye to the
parent glaciers. This view I was fortunately able to enjoy rather longer
than that from the mouth of the Schafloch; for we had made such rapid way,
that Christian found there was time for a meal of milk in the
ch&acirc;let, and meanwhile left me lying in perfect luxury on the sweet
grass.</p>

<p>From the Ralligflue a long and remarkably steep zigzag leads to the
lower ground, and down this Christian ran at full speed, jodeling in a
most trying manner; indeed, at one of the sudden turns of the path he went
off triumphantly into a falsetto so unearthly, that he lost his legs, and
landed in a promiscuous sort of way on a lower part of the zigzag, after
which he was slower and less vocal.</p>

<p>We eventually reached Gonten so soon, that there was time to cool and
have a bath in the lake; and when that was nearly finished, Christian
brought a plate of cherries and a detachment of the village, and I ate the
cherries and held a lev&eacute;e in the boat--very literally a
lev&eacute;e, as the dressing was by no means accomplished when the
deputation arrived. My late guide, now, <a name="Page_155"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;155]</span></a> as he said, a friend for life, made a
speech to the people, setting forth that he had done that day what he had
never thought to do; for, often as he had been to the entrance of the
Schafloch--five or six times at the least--he had never before reached the
end of the cave. And to whom, he asked, did he owe it? All previous
Herrschaft under his charge had cried <i>Immer zur&uuml;ck!</i> but this
present Herr had known but one cry, <i>Immer vorw&auml;rts!</i> Luckily
the steamer now approached, so the speech came to an end, and he shook
hands affectionately, with a vigour that would certainly have transmitted
some of the dye, if that material had not become a part of the skin which
it coloured. Then the village also shook hands, having evidently
understood what Christian said, notwithstanding the fact that it was
intelligible German, and I returned to Thun and Berne.</p>

<p>No. 53 was still the only bed disengaged, for it was very late when I
reached Berne; but on my vehement protestations against that unquiet
chamber, the landlord most obligingly converted a sofa in his own
sitting-room into a temporary bed, and made it over to me. This room was
separated by a door of ground-glass from another sitting-room brilliantly
lighted, in which a number of German young gentlemen were f&ecirc;ting the
return of a comrade after the national manner. The landlord said he
thought it must soon be over, for he doubted whether they could last much
longer; but their powers of endurance were greater than he had supposed.
It will readily be imagined that German songs with a good chorus, the solo
parts being very short, and received with the utmost impatience by the
chorus, were even less soporific in their effect than the
flirtations--though boisterous beyond all conventional propriety--of
German housemaids and waiters.<a name="FNanchor65"></a><a href=

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<a name="Page_157"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;157]</span></a>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF GRAND ANU, ON THE MONTAGNE DE L'EAU, NEAR
ANNECY.</h3>

<p>M. Thury's list contained a bare mention of two glaci&egrave;res on the
M. Parmelan, near Annecy, without any further information respecting them,
beyond the fact that they supplied ice for Lyons. Their existence had been
apparently reported to him by M. Alphonse Favre, but he had obtained no
account of a visit to the caves. Under these circumstances, the only plan
was to go to Annecy, and trust to chance for finding some one there who
could assist me in my search.</p>

<p>After spending a day or two in the library at Geneva, looking up M.
Thury's references, with respect to various ice-caves, and trying to
discover something more than he had found in the books there, I started
for Annecy at seven in the morning in the banquette of the diligence. On a
fresher day, no doubt the great richness of the orchards and corn-fields
would have been very striking; but on this particular morning the fields
were already trembling with heat, and the trees and the fruit covered with
dust; and there was nothing in the grouping of the country through which
the road lay to refresh the baked and half-choked traveller. The voyage
was to last four and a half hours, and it soon became a serious question
how far it would be possible to face the heat of noon, when the earlier
morning was so utterly unbearable.</p>

<a name="Page_158"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;158]</span></a>

<p>Before very long, a counter-irritant appeared in the shape of a
fellow-traveller, whose luggage consisted of a stick and an old pair of
boots. The man was not pleasant to be near in any way, and he was
evidently not at all satisfied with the amount of room I allowed him. He
kept discontentedly and doggedly pushing his spare pair of boots farther
and farther into my two-thirds of the seat, and once or twice was on the
point of a protest, in which case I was prepared to tell him that as he
filled the whole banquette with his smell, he ought in reason to be
satisfied with less room for himself; but instead of speaking, he brought
out a tobacconist's parcel and began to open it. Tobacco-smoke is all very
well under suitable circumstances, but it is possible to be too hot and
dusty and bilious to be able to stand it, and I watched his proceedings
with more of annoyance than of resignation. The parcel turned out,
however, to be delightful snuff, tastefully perfumed and very refreshing;
and the politeness with which the owner gave a pinch to the foreign
monsieur, after apportioning a handful to the driver and conductor, won
him a good three inches more of seat. The inevitable cigar soon came; but
it was a very good one, and no one could complain: all the same, I could
not help feeling a malicious satisfaction when the <i>douaniers</i> on the
French frontier investigated the spare boots--guiltless, one might have
thought, of anything except the extremity of age and dirt--and drew from
them a bundle or two of smuggled cigars, the owner trying in vain to look
as if he rather liked it.</p>

<p>The H&ocirc;tel de Gen&egrave;ve is probably the least objectionable of
the hotels of Annecy; but the Poste-bureau is at the H&ocirc;tel
d'Angleterre, and it was much too hot for me to fight with the waiters
there, and carry off my knapsack to another house. It is generally a
mistake--a great mistake--to sleep at a house which is the starting-place
and the goal of many diligences. All the night through, whips are
cracking, bells <a name="Page_159"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;159]</span></a> jingling, and men are shouting hoarsely or
blowing hoarser horns. Moreover, the H&ocirc;tel d'Angleterre had
apparently needed a fresh coat of paint and universal papering for many
years, and the latter need had at this crisis been so far grappled with
that the old paper had been torn down from the walls and now lay on the
various floors, while large pies of malodorous sizing had been planted at
the angles of the stairs. The natural <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i> was
evidently an excellent room, with oleander balconies, but it was at
present in the hands of joiners, and a card pointed the way to the
'provisionary <i>salle-&agrave;-manger'</i>--not a bad name for it--in the
neighbourhood of the kitchen.</p>

<p>There was one redeeming feature. The people of the house were
nice-looking and well-dressed. But experience has taught me to view such a
phenomenon in French towns of humbler rank with somewhat mixed feelings.
When the house is superintended with a keen and watchful eye by a young
lady of fashionable appearance, who takes a personal interest in a
solitary traveller, and suggests an evening's <i>course</i> on the lake,
or a morning's drive to some good view, and makes herself most winning and
agreeable; who takes the words, moreover, out of the mouth of a man
meditating an ordinary dinner, and assures him that she knows exactly what
he wants, and he shall be well satisfied, with a sisterly air that makes
the idea of francs and sous not sordid only, but impossible; I have slowly
learned to expect that this fashion and condescension will appear in the
bill. Prettiness is a very expensive item in such a case; and as these
three were all combined to a somewhat remarkable degree at the H&ocirc;tel
d'Angleterre, the eventual bill made me angry, and I should certainly try
the H&ocirc;tel de Gen&egrave;ve on any future visit to Annecy.</p>

<a name="Page_160"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;160]</span></a>

<p>The first thing to be done was to determine the position of the Mont
Parmelan. I was prepared to find the people of the town denying the
existence of such a mountain; but, as it was visible from the door of the
hotel, they could not go quite so far as that. The small crowd at the door
repudiated the glaci&egrave;res with one voice, and pointed out how
unlikely it was that Lyons should be supplied with ice from Annecy;
nevertheless, I continued to ask my way in spite of protestation, till at
length a lame man passed by, who said monsieur was quite right--he himself
knew two glaci&egrave;res on the Mont Parmelan very well. He had never
seen either of them, but he knew them as well as if he had. It was useless
to go to them now, he added, for the owners extracted all the ice early in
the year, and stored it in holes in the lower part of the mountain. He had
no idea by what route they were to be approached from Annecy, or on which
side of the Mont Parmelan they lay.</p>

<p>I now looked on the local map, and determined that the best plan would
be to take the Bonneville diligence as far as Charvonnaz, the point on the
road which seemed to lie nearest to the roots of the Mont Parmelan, and
then be guided by what I might learn among the peasants. Everyone said
there was no chance of getting to anything by that means; but as the hotel
people saw that it was of no use to deny the glaci&egrave;res any longer,
they proposed to take me to a man who knew the M. Parmelan well, and could
tell me all about it. This man proved to be a keeper of voitures,--an
ominous profession under the circumstances,--and he assured me that I
could make a most lovely <i>course</i> the next day, through scenery of
unrivalled beauty; and he eloquently told on his fingers the villages and
sights I should come to. I suggested--without in the least knowing that it
was so--that the drive might be all very well in itself, but it would not
bring me to the glaci&egrave;res; on which he assured me that he knew
every inch of the mountain, and there was not <a name="Page_161"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;161]</span></a> such a thing as a
glaci&egrave;re in the whole district. At this moment, a gentlemanlike man
was brought up by the waiter, and introduced to me as a monsieur who knew
a monsieur who knew the proprietor of one of the glaci&egrave;res, and
would he happy to conduct me to this second monsieur: so, without any very
ceremonious farewell to the owner of the proffered voiture, we marched off
together down the street, and eventually turned into a <i>caf&eacute;</i>,
whose master was the monsieur for whom we were in search. Know the
glaci&egrave;re?--yes, indeed! he had ice from it one year every morning.
His wife and he had made a <i>course</i> to the campagne of M. the Maire
of Aviernoz, and he--the caf&eacute;tier--had descended for miles, as it
were, down and down, till he came to an underground world of ice,
wonderful, totally wonderful: there he perceived so immense a cold, that
he drank a bottle of rhoom--a whole bottle--and drank it from the neck,
<i>&agrave; l'Anglaise</i>. And when they had gone so far that great dread
came upon them, they rolled a stone down the ice, and it went into the
darkness--boom, boom, boom,--and he put on a power of ventriloquism which
admirably represented the strange suggestive sound. Hold a moment! had
monsieur a crayon? Yes, monsieur had; so the things were impetuously swept
off a round marble table, and the excited little man drew a fancy portrait
of the glaci&egrave;re. The way to reach it? Go by diligence to
Charvonnaz--exactly what I had determined upon--and walk up to Aviernoz,
where his good friend the maire would make me see his beautiful
glaci&egrave;re, through the means of a letter which he went to write. It
was absurd to see this hot little man sign himself 'Dugravel, <i>
glacier</i>,' that being the style of his profession, naturally recalling
the contradictory conduct of the Latin noun <i>lucus</i>.</p>

<p>The bones of S. Francis of Sales lie in the church of S.
Fran&ccedil;ois in <a name="Page_162"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;162]</span></a> Annecy, and I made a pilgrimage in search of
them through very unpleasant streets. After a time, the Italian west front
of the church appeared; but the main door led into a demonstrative bakery,
and the door of the north aisle was obscured by oleanders and a striped
awning, and over it appeared the legend, '<i>Entr&eacute;e de
l'H&ocirc;tel</i>.' As a man politely explained, they had built S. Francis
another church, and utilised the old one. The town itself seemed to be of
the squalid style of antiquity--old, no doubt, but very dirty. It is
pervaded by streams, which crop up among the houses, and flow through dark
alleys and vaulted passages, rarely coming into daylight, and suggesting
all manner of dark crimes. The red-legged French kettledrums are, if
possible, more insolent here than in other places, and it is evident that
the dogs are not yet reconciled to the annexation, for the guard swept
through the streets amid a perfect tornado of howls from the negligent
scavengers of the place. For my own part, I was not pleased with the
change of rule, when I found that since Annecy has become French, the <i>
vin d'Asti</i> has become dear, as being now a foreign wine.</p>

<p>The diligence for Bonneville was to leave Annecy at half-past four in
the morning; so I told them to call me at four, intending to breakfast
somewhere on the way. But of course, when four o'clock came, I had to call
myself, and in a quarter of an hour a knock at the door announced
half-past four. I pounced upon the man, and remonstrated with him, but <a
name="Page_163"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;163]</span></a> he
assured me it did not matter; and when I reminded him that the diligence
was to leave at half-past four, he observed philosophically that it was
quite true, and I had better make haste, for the poste was very punctual.
At the door of the bureau a loaded diligence stood, marked <i>
Annecy--Aix</i>, and I asked had the Bonneville diligence gone? It did not
go till six, the clerk told me; but I reminded him he had said half-past
four when I asked him last night. Half-past four?--true, here was the
carriage standing at the door. But that was for Aix, not Bonneville, I
pointed out to him. Pardon--it was marked Aix, but was in fact meant for
Bonneville.</p>

<p>The diligence reached the end of the by-road leading to Villaz in about
half an hour, and all the fever of Geneva and Annecy seemed to fly away
before the freshness of this green little lane, with clematis in full
flower pervading the hedges, and huge clusters of young nuts peeping out,
and promising later delights to fortunate passers-by. But, alas! the
little lane soon came to an end, and as I faced the fields of corn up the
mountain-side, the hot thunderous air came rolling down in palpable
billows, and oppressive clouds took possession of the surrounding hills.
Three-quarters of an hour brought me to Villaz, a close collection of
houses on the hill-side, with arched stone gateways leading into the
farmyards,--a fortified style of agricultural building which seems to
prevail in that district. After an amount of experience in out-of-the-way
places which makes me very cautious in saying that one in particular is
dirtier than a dozen others, I venture to say that the <i>auberge</i> of
Villaz is the most squalid I have come across; and I would not feed there
again, except in very robust health, even for a new glaci&egrave;re.
Still, it was absolutely necessary to eat something, and the landlady
promised coffee and bread. She showed me first into the kitchen; but as it
was also the place where the domestics slept, with many quadrupeds, I
declined to sit there. Upon this she led me to the <i>salon</i>, where the
window resisted all our efforts for some little time, and then opened upon
such a choice assortment of abominations, that I fled without my baggage.
The next attempt she made was the one remaining <a name="Page_164"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;164]</span></a> room of the house, the family
bedroom; but that was so much worse than all, that I took final refuge on
the balcony, a sort of ante-room to the hen-house. The cocks at the <i>
auberge</i> of Villaz are the loudest, the hens the most talkative, and
the cats the most shaggy and presuming, I have ever met with. Even here,
however, all was not unmitigated darkness; for they ground the coffee
while the water was boiling, and the consequent decoction was admirable.
Moreover, the bread had a skin of such thickness and impervious toughness,
that the inside was presumably clean.</p>

<p>Aviernoz lay about an hour farther. Almost as soon as I left Villaz,
the thunderstorm came on in earnest, with sheets of rain, a regular <i>
Wolkenbruch</i>.<a name="FNanchor66"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> The rain was most refreshing; but
lightning is not a pleasant companion in presence of a bright ice-axe, and
I was glad when the houses of Aviernoz came in sight. The village had the
appearance of being lost; and the houses were scattered about so
irregularly, that it was difficult to know which was the best point to
make for. The road studiously avoided the scattered houses, and the <i>
Mairie</i> seemed especially difficult to find. When at length it was
found, the maire, like the queen in the poets, was in the kitchen; and he
sat affably on the end of a bench and read the letter of introduction
aloud, asking me, at the conclusion, how was our friend Dugravel, a man
amazing in many ways. When I confessed that I had only made the
acquaintance of the amazing man the night before, and therefore did not
feel competent to give any reliable account of the state of his health,
beyond the fact that he seemed to be in excellent spirits, the maire
looked upon me evidently with great respect, as having won so far upon a
great character like Dugravel in so short a time, and determined to
accompany me himself.<a name="Page_165"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;165]</span></a> Meantime, we must drink some kirsch.
The maire was a young man, spare and vehement. He talked with a headlong
impetuosity which caused him to be always hot, and his hair limp and
errant; and at the end of each sentence there were so many laggard halves
of words to come out together, with so little breath to bring them out,
that he eventuated in a stuttering scream. His clothes were of such a
description, that the most speculative Israelite would not have gone
beyond copper for his wardrobe, all standing. There were two women in the
house, to whom he was exceedingly imperious: one of them received his
orders and his vehemence with a certain amount of defiance, but the other
was subdued and obedient, and I believe her to have been the mayoress. He
poured himself and his household at my feet, knocked a child one way and
his wife another, and, from the air with which he dragged off the
tablecloth they had laid, and ordered a better, and swept away the glasses
because they were not clean enough--which in itself was sufficiently
true,--and screamed for poached eggs for monsieur, and then impetuously
ate them himself--I fancy that he might have been taught to play Petrucio
with success.</p>

<p>When we had sat for a quarter of an hour or so, a heavy-looking young
man, in fustian clothes and last year's linen, came into the room, and was
introduced as the communal schoolmaster. We shook hands with much
impressment on the strength of the similarity of our professions, and the
maire explained that the new arrival acted also as his secretary, for
there was really so much writing to be done that it was beyond his own
powers; and as the schoolmaster lived <i>en pension</i> at the <i>
Mairie</i>, it was very convenient. M. Rosset, the schoolmaster, stated
that he had heard us, as he sat in his room, talking of the proposed visit
to the <a name="Page_166"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;166]</span></a>
glaci&egrave;re, and he should much wish to accompany us. We both
expressed the warmest satisfaction; but the maire suggested--how about the
boys? That, M. Rosset said, was simple enough. The world would go to the
school at nine o'clock, and, finding no schoolmaster, would go home again,
or otherwise employ itself; and he could have school on the weekly
holiday, to make up for the lost day. This weekly holiday is universally
on Thursday, he said, because that day divides the week so well; and I
failed to persuade him that there was a commemoration intended in the
choice of that day, as in the observance of Friday and Sunday. The maire
utterly refused to take a cord, on the ground that there was no
possibility of such a thing being of the least use. Fortunately, I had now
my own axe, which in more able hands had mounted more than once Mont Blanc
and Monte Rosa, so I had not the usual fight to procure that
instrument.</p>

<p>Half an hour from the <i>Mairie</i>, when we had well commenced the
steep ascent of the mountain-side, the maire turned suddenly round and
exclaimed, 'But the inspector!' Rosset was a sallow man, but he contrived
to turn white, while M. M&eacute;tral (the maire) explained to me that the
inspector of schools was to visit Aviernoz that day. The schoolmaster
recovered before long, and said he should inform the inspector that a
famous <i>savant</i> had come from England, and required that the maire
and the <i>instituteur</i> should accompany him to the glaci&egrave;re, to
aid him in making scientific observations. In order that he might have
documentary proof to advance, he asked for my card, and made me write on
it my college and university in full.</p>

<p>As I have already said, the maire's style of talking required a good
deal of breath, and so it was not unnatural that the ascent should reduce
him to silence. The schoolmaster talked freely about scholastic affairs,
and gave me an account of the ordinary tariff in village <a name=
"Page_167"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;167]</span></a> schools,
though each commune may alter the prices of its school if it please. Under
seven years of age, children pay 4 francs a year, or, for shorter periods
than a year, at the rate of 75 centimes a month; between seven and
thirteen, 6 francs a year, or 1 franc a month; from thirteen to eighteen,
8 francs a year, or 1 f. 50 c. a month. There is the same difficulty in
France, of course, as with us, in keeping children at school after they
are old enough to earn a few centimes by cattle-keeping; and the Ministry
of Education had shortly before addressed questions to every schoolmaster
in the country, asking what remedy each could suggest. My present friend
had replied, that if the Government would give the education gratis,
something might be done; but he had expressed his opinion that nothing
short of an actual subsidy to parents of children beyond eight or nine
years of age would ensure a general improvement.</p>

<p>Having given me this information, he observed that it was every man's
business to learn, though he and I might be teachers also, and therefore
he was sure monsieur would pardon him if he asked what those black patches
on monsieur's hands might mean,--pointing to certain large areas of Epsom
plaster which covered the tokens of many glaci&egrave;res. When his mind
was set at rest as to this phenomenon, the maire called a halt, and took
his turn of talking. He began to tell me about himself and his wealth,
Rosset backing him up and putting in the most telling parts. He had very
extensive property, and the more level parts of it were certainly
valuable, consisting of 200 <i>journaux</i> of good arable land: the
forests through which we walked were his, and he possessed three <i>
montagnes</i> and ch&acirc;lets higher up on the mountain. The
glaci&egrave;re was his own property; and two years ago he had discovered
another in the neighbourhood, which he had not since visited. He was
assisted in his <a name="Page_168"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;168]</span></a> capacity of maire by twelve councillors--in a
larger commune it would have been fifteen--and the council met four times
in the year. If it was desirable that they should meet on any other
occasion, he must write to the prefect of the arrondissement for
permission, specifying the business which they wished to conduct, and to
this specified business they must confine themselves entirely. Then he
wished to know, had we maires such as he in England? Hereupon I drew a
fancy picture of the Lord Mayor of London, receiving the Queen and the
Royal Family in general in a friendly way, and giving them a
dinner,--which, he observed, must cost a good deal, a great deal. However,
he looked round upon his fields and houses and mountains, and seemed to
think that he could himself stand a considerable drain upon his purse for
the reception of royalty; and possibly he is now anxious that the Emperor
should pass that way, during the five years to which the tenure of the
mayoralty is restricted. Both of my companions were strong in their French
sympathies--the one because under the new rule all communal affairs were
so much better organised, the other because a wonderful change for the
better had taken place in the government superintendence of schools.
Theirs was formerly an odd corner of a kingdom that did not care much
about them, and was not homogeneous; it was now an integral part of a
well-ordered empire. They confessed that the present state of things cost
them much more in taxes, &amp;c., excepting in the upper mountains, where
Rosset had a cousin who paid even less than under Sardinian rule.</p>

<p>Of course, we talked a little on Church questions; and they were
astonished to hear that I was not only an ecclesiastic, but an ordained
priest,--a sort of thing which they had fancied did not exist in the
English Church. Rosset said the <i>cur&eacute;s</i> of small communes had
about &pound;40 <a name="Page_169"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;169]</span></a> a year, but I must have more than that, or I
could not afford to travel so far from home. Had I already said the mass
that morning? Had I my robes in the <i>sac</i> I had left at the <i>
Mairie</i>? Was the red book they had seen in my hands (B&auml;deker's <i>
Schweiz</i>) a Breviary? They branched off to matters of doctrine, and
discussed them warmly; but some things they so accommodatingly
understated, and others they stated so fairly, that I was able to tell
them they were excellent Anglicans.</p>

<p>Higher up in the forest, we were nearly overwhelmed by a party of
charcoal-porters, who came down with their <i>tra&icirc;neaux</i> like a
black avalanche. A <i>tra&icirc;neau</i> is nothing more than a wooden
sledge, on two runners, which are turned up in front, to the height of a
yard, to keep the cargo in its place. In the more level parts the porter
is obliged to drag this, but on the steep zigzags its own weight is
sufficient to send it down; and here the porter places himself in front,
with his back leaning against the sacks of charcoal and the turned-up
runners, and the whole mass descends headlong, the man's legs going at a
wild pace, and now one foot, now the other, steering a judicious course at
the turns of the zigzags. The charcoal is made by Italians, who live on
polenta and cheese high up in the mountains, and bring their manufacture
down to a certain distance, after which the porters take it in charge. The
men we saw told us that by hard work they could make four journeys in the
day, earning a franc by each; out of which, as they said, they must
support stomach and boots, one journey making them ready for a meal, and
eight journeys finishing a pair of soles.</p>

<p>It cost us an hour and a half to reach the maire's first ch&acirc;let,
where we were to lunch on such food as the old woman who managed it might
have on hand; that is to say, possibly bread, and, beyond that, milk only,
in <a name="Page_170"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;170]</span></a>
some shape or other. The forms under which milk can be taught to appear
are manifold. A young Swiss student, who in the madness of his passion for
beetle-hunting had spent fifteen days in a small ch&acirc;let at
Anzeindaz, sleeping each night on the hay,<a name="FNanchor67"></a><a

<p>Some of the solids and fluids in the earlier part of this <i>carte</i>
we felt tolerably sure of finding at the maire's ch&acirc;let, and
accordingly any amount of cream and <i>s&eacute;ret</i> proved to be
forthcoming. The maire asserted that <i>c&eacute;rac</i> was the true name
of this recommendable article of food, <i>c&eacute;r&eacute;</i> being the
patois for the original word. Others had told us that the real word was
<i>serr&eacute;</i>, meaning <i>compressed</i> curds; but the French
writers who treat learnedly of cheese-making in the <i>Annales de
Chimie</i> adopt the form <i>s&eacute;rets</i>; and in the <i>Annales
Scientifiques de <a name="Page_171"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;171]</span></a> l'Auvergne</i> I find both <i>seret</i> and <i>
serai</i>, from the Latin <i>serum</i>.There was also bread, which arrived
when we were sitting down to our meal: it had been baked in a huge ring,
for convenience of carriage, and was brought up from the low-lands on a
stick across a boy's shoulder. When the old woman thought it safe to
expose a greater dainty to our attacks, at a later period of the meal, she
brought out a pot of <i>caill&eacute;</i>, a delightful luxury which
prevails in the form of nuggets of various size floating in sour whey.
Owing to a general want of table apparatus, we placed the pot of
caill&eacute; on a broken wall, and speared the nuggets with our
pocket-knives.</p>

<p>After the meal, the two Frenchmen found themselves wet and exceedingly
cold; for Frenchmen have not yet learned the blessing of flannel shirts
under a broiling sun. They set to work to dry themselves after an original
fashion. The fire was little more than a collection of smouldering embers,
confined within three stone walls about a foot high; so they took each a
one-legged stool--<i>chaises des vaches</i>, or <i>chaise des
montagnes</i>--and attached themselves to the stools by the usual leathern
bands round the hips; then they cautiously planted the prods of the stools
in the middle of the embers, maintaining an unstable equilibrium by
resting their own legs on the top of the walls. Here they sat, smoking and
being smoked, till they were dry and warm. Of course, in case of a slip or
an inadvertent movement, they would have gone sprawling into the fire. A
well-known Swiss botanist, who has seen many strange sleeping-places in
the course of sixty years of flower-hunting in the mountains of Vaud and
Valais, has told me that on one occasion he had reached with great
difficulty the only ch&acirc;let in the neighbourhood of his day's
researches, at a late hour of the night, the whole mountain <a name=
"Page_172"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;172]</span></a> being soaked
with rain. It was a little upland ch&acirc;let, which the people had
deserted for the autumn and winter; and meantime a mud avalanche had taken
possession, and covered the floor to a depth of several inches. No plank
was to be found for lying on; but he discovered a broken one-legged stool,
and on this he sat and slept, propped as well as might be in a corner. It
is difficult to say which would be worse--a fall from the stool by
daylight into the embers of a wood fire, or the shuddering slimy waking
about midnight, after a nod more vigorous than the rest, to find oneself
plunged in eight cold inches of soft mud.</p>

<p>About half an hour beyond the ch&acirc;let, we found the mouth of the
glaci&egrave;re, on a large plateau almost bare of vegetation, and showing
the live rock at the surface. They told me that in a strong winter there
would be an average of 12 feet of snow on the ground here.<a name=
"FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> The
glaci&egrave;re itself is approached by descending one side of a deep pit,
whose circumference is larger than that of any other of the
pit-glaci&egrave;res I have seen. A few yards off there is a smaller shaft
in the rock, which we afterwards found to communicate with the
glaci&egrave;re. The NW. side of the larger pit, being the side at the
bottom of which is the arch of entrance, is vertical, and we spent the
time necessary for growing cool in measuring the height of this face of
rock from above. The plummet ran out 115 feet of string, and struck the
slope of snow, down which the descent to the cave must be made, about 6
feet above the junction of the snow with the floor of the glaci&egrave;re,
which was visible <a name="Page_173"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;173]</span></a> from the S. side of the edge of the pit; so
that the total depth from the surface of the rock to the ice-floor was 121
feet.</p>

<div class="centerme"><img alt="VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF
GRAND ANU, NEAR ANNECY." src="images/image12.jpg" width="279" height=

 <span class="caption">VERTICAL SECTION OF THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF GRAND
ANU, NEAR ANNECY.</span></div>

<br />


<p>When we were sufficiently cool, we scrambled down the side of the pit
opposite to that in which the archway lies, finding the rock extremely
steep, and then came to a slope of 72 feet of snow, completely exposed to
the weather, which landed us at the mouth of the glaci&egrave;re. The arch
is so large, that we could detect the change of light in the cave, <a
name="Page_174"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;174]</span></a> caused by
the passage of clouds across the sun, and candles were not necessary,
excepting in the pits shortly to be described. We saw at once that rapid
thaw was going on somewhere or other; and when we stepped off the snow, we
found ourselves in a couple of inches of soft green vegetable mud, like a
<i>compote</i> of dark-coloured duckweed--or, to use a more familiar
simile, like a mass of overboiled and ill-strained spinach. To the grief
of one of us, there was ice under this, of most persuasive slipperiness.
The maire said that he had never seen these signs of thaw in his visits in
previous years; and as we went farther and farther into the cave, he was
more and more surprised at each step to find such a large quantity of
running water, and so much less ice than he had expected. The shape of the
glaci&egrave;re is a rough circle, 60 feet in diameter; and the floor,
which is solid ice, slopes gradually down to the farther end. The
immediate entrance is half-closed by a steep and very regular cone of
snow, lying vertically under the small shaft we had seen in the rock
above. The snow which forms the cone descends in winter by this shaft; and
the formation must have been going on for a considerable time, since the
lower part of the cone has become solid ice, under the combined influences
of pressure and of <i>d&eacute;gel</i> and <i>regel</i>. I climbed up the
side of this, by cutting steps in the lower part, and digging feet and
hands deep into the snow higher up; and I found the length of the side to
be 30 feet. I had no means of determining the height of the cave, and a
guess might not be of much value.</p>

<p>At first sight, the farther end of the cave was the most striking. The
water which comes from the melting snow down which we had passed in
reaching the glaci&egrave;re, had cut itself deep channels in the floor,
and through these it coursed rapidly till it precipitated itself into a
large pit or <i>moulin</i> in the ice, at the lowest point. This pit, <a
name="Page_175"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;175]</span></a> as will
be seen by the section of the cave given on p. 174,<a name=
"FNanchor71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> terminates the
glaci&egrave;re; and the rock-wall at the farther edge falls away into a
sort of open fissure, down which magnificent cascades of ice stream
emulously, clothing that side of the pit, which would otherwise be solid
rock. We cut a few steps about the upper edge of this <i>moulin</i>, to
make all safe, and proceeded to let down a lighted candle, which descended
safely for 36 feet, showing nothing but ice on all sides; it then came in
contact with one of the falls of water, and the light was of course
extinguished. We next tied a stone to the string, and found that after 40
feet it struck on ice and turned inwards, under our feet, stopping finally
at the end of 51 feet; but whether it was really the bottom of the pit
that stopped it, or only some ledge or accidental impediment, we could not
determine. The diameter of this pit might be 3 yards, but we took no
measure of it.</p>

<p>At the extreme right of the cave we found another pit, a yard and a
half across, two-thirds of the circumference of which was formed by the
plateau of ice on which we stood, and the remaining third by a fluting in
the wall of rock. The maire said that, two years ago, this hole was not
visible, being concealed by a large ice-column which had since fallen in.
Here again I let down a lighted candle, with more hopes of getting it to
the bottom, as no part of the cave drained into the pit. The candle
descended steadily, the flame showing no signs of atmospheric disturbance,
and revealing the fact that the opposite side of the pit, viz. the rock,
which alone was visible from our position, became more and more thickly
covered with ice, of exquisite clearness, and varied and most graceful
forms.<a name="Page_176"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;176]</span></a>
As foot after foot, and yard after yard, ran out, and our heads craned
farther and farther over the edge of the pit to follow the descending
light, (we lay flat on the ice, for more safety,) the cries of the
schoolmaster became mere howls, and the maire lapsed into oaths heavy
enough to break in the ice. It is always sufficiently disagreeable to hear
men swear; but in situations which have anything impressive, either of
danger or of grandeur, it becomes more than ever unbearable. I remember on
one occasion over-taking a large party in the descent from the Plateau to
the Grands Mulets, in a place where the snow was extremely soft, and any
moment might land one of us in a crevasse; and I shall never forget the
oaths which caught my ear, from a floundering fellow-countryman enveloped
from the waist downwards.</p>

<p>When 60 feet had run out, the candle stopped, and on stretching over I
saw that it had reached a slope of ice which inclined very steeply
northwards, and passed away under the rock, apparently into a fresh
cavern. By raising the candle slightly and then letting it drop, we made
it glide down this slope for 8 feet; and then it finally rested on a shelf
of ice, showing us the shadowy beginnings of what should be a most
glorious ice-cave. The little light which the candle gave was made the
most of by the reflecting material which surrounded it; and we were able
to see that the archway in the rock was rounded off with grey ice, and
rested, as it were, on icy pillars. As far as we could judge, there would
have been abundant room to pass down the slope under the archway, if only
the preliminary 60 feet could by any means have been accomplished; and I
shall dream for long of what there must be down there.</p>

<p>As I was anxious to know whether the side of the pit was vertical ice
under our feet, I contrived to get about a third of the way round the <a
name="Page_177"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;177]</span></a> edge, so
as almost to reach the fluting in the rock which formed the farther side
of the pit, and then desired the schoolmaster to raise the candle slowly
from the ledge on which it still rested. As he pulled it gradually up, I
was startled to find that the ice fell away sharply immediately below the
spot where we had been collected, and then formed a solid wall; so that we
had been standing on the mere edge of a shelf, with nothing but black
emptiness below. How far the solid wall receded at the bottom I was unable
to determine, for the light of one candle was of very little use at so
great a distance, and in darkness so profound. I persuaded the maire to
make an effort to reach a point from which he could see the insecurity of
the ice which had seemed to form so solid a floor; and he was so much
impressed by what he saw, that he fled with precipitation from the cave,
and we eventually found him asleep under a bush on the rocks above. In
reaching the farther side of the pit, we crossed unwittingly an ice-bridge
formed by a transverse pit or tunnel in the ice, which opened into the pit
we were examining. The maire afterwards promised to rail off all that end
of the glaci&egrave;re, and forbid his workmen to venture upon it.
Considering that the hole itself was only opened two years before by the
fall of a column, and has already undergone such changes, I shall be
surprised if the ice-bridge, and all that part on which we lay to fathom
the pit, does not fall in before very long; and then, by means of steps
and ropes and ladders, it may be possible to reach the entrance to the
lower cave, 190 feet below the surface of the earth. May I be there to
see!<a name="FNanchor72"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p>The left side of the glaci&egrave;re, near the entrance, was occupied
by a <a name="Page_178"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;178]</span></a>
columnar cascade, behind which I forced a passage by chopping away some
lovely ornaments of ice. Here also the solid ground-ice falls away a
little under the surface, leaving a cavern 8 or 9 feet deep, on the rock
side of which every possible glacial fantasy was to be found. The
stalactites here presented the peculiar prismatic structure so often
noticed; but on the more exposed side of the column they were tipped with
limpid ice, free from all apparent external or internal lines. This
reminded me of what we had observed in the Glaci&egrave;re of La
Genolli&egrave;re, namely, that the surface-lines tended to disappear
under thaw; so I cut a piece of prismatic ice and put it in my mouth. In a
short time it became perfectly limpid, and on breaking it up I could
discover no signs of prism. On some parts of the floor of the
glaci&egrave;re, the ice was apparently unprismatic, generally in
connection with running water or other marks of thaw; but, to my surprise,
I found that it split into prisms very readily.</p>

<p>The maire could not understand how it was that, after a winter
especially severe, as that of 1863-4 had been, there should be even less
ice than in the preceding summer, and we could see the marks of last
year's cutting, down to the edge of the <i>moulin</i>. He said that they
had never before cut down in that direction; but in the summer of 1863
they had been so much struck by the clearness of the ice which formed the
floor, that they had cut it freely, and removed a large quantity. This, I
believe, was the cause of the absence of any great amount of fresh ice.
The slope of the whole ice-floor is considerable, and the workmen
increased the slope by cutting away the ice in the neighbourhood of the
edge of the <i>moulin</i>: they had also, as we could see quite plainly,
excavated the clearer parts of the ice between the entrance to the cave
and the <i>moulin</i>, so that a sort of trough ran down from near the
foot of the snow to the pit at the lower end of the glaci&egrave;re. When
we were <a name="Page_179"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;179]</span></a> there, the water rushed down this trough, and
was lost in the pit; and very probably the same may have been the case in
the earlier parts of the year, when, according to the view I have already
expressed, the ice would under ordinary circumstances have been formed. If
this be so, the caverns below must have received immense additions to
their stores of ice or water. We observed, by the way, that the slope of
ice to which the candle descended in the deeper pit, and the shelf on
which it rested, were quite dry, or at any rate free from all apparent
signs of the abundant water we should have seen, had that been the outlet
for the streams which poured into the <i>moulin</i>. The maire said that
the columns and cascades of ice in the cave had been much more beautiful
in the previous summer.</p>

<p>The whole cavern would thus appear to be something of the shape of an
egg, with the longer axis vertical, and the entrance about half-way up the
side. The lower end of this egg-shaped cavity in the rock is filled with
ice, which in some parts shrinks from the rock below the surface, though,
as far as outward appearance goes, it fills the cavern to its farthest
corners. The depth of this ice at one side is 60 feet, and how much more
it may be in the middle it is impossible to say. As we have seen, there is
a second ice-cave opening out of the principal one, at a depth of 190 feet
below the surface; and with respect to this second cave imagination may
run riot. Rosset told me that he had noticed, the year before, a strong
source of water springing out of the side of a rock, at some little
distance from the glaci&egrave;re; but he could not reach it then, and
could not find it now. This may possibly be the drainage of the
glaci&egrave;re in its summer state.</p>

<p>The thermometer stood at 34&deg; in the middle of the cave; and though
the others felt the cold very much, I was myself surprised to find so low
a register, for the atmosphere seemed to <a name="Page_180"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;180]</span></a> be comparatively warm, judging from
what I had experienced in other glaci&egrave;res. The only current of air
we could detect was exceedingly slight, and came from the deeper of the
two pits in the ice. It was so slight, that the flame of the candle burned
apparently quite steadily when we were engaged in determining the depth
and shape of the pit.</p>

<p>The sun had by this time produced such an effect upon the slope of snow
outside the glaci&egrave;re, that we found the ascent sufficiently
difficult, especially as our hands were full of various instruments. The
schoolmaster was not content to choose the straight line up, and in
attempting to perform a zigzag, he came to a part of the slope where the
snow lay about 2 inches thick on solid ice, and the result was an
unscholastic descent in inverted order of precedence. He got on better
over the rolling stones after the snow was accomplished, but the clumsy
style of his climbing dislodged an unpleasant amount and weight of
missiles; and though he was amiable enough to cry '<i>Garde</i>!' with
every step he took, it will be found by experiment that it is not much use
to the lower man to have '<i>Garde</i>!' shouted in his ears, when his
footing is insecure to begin with, and a large stone comes full at his
head, at the precise moment when two others are taking him in the pit of
the stomach.</p>

<p>We found the maire, as was said, asleep under a bush near the mouth of
the pit; and he pronounced himself completely recovered from the effects
of the cold, and ready to guide us to a second glaci&egrave;re. He told us
that the amount of ice he sold averaged 4,000 <i>quintaux
m&eacute;triques</i> a week, for the three months of July, August, and
September; but the last winter had been so severe, that the lake had
provided ice for the artificial glaci&egrave;res of Annecy, and no one had
as yet applied to him this year. As <a name="Page_181"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;181]</span></a> only a fortnight of his usual season
had passed, he may have since had plenty of applications, later in the
year. The railways have opened up more convenient sources of ice for
Lyons, and for some time he has sent none to that town.</p>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF CHAPPET-SUR-VILLAZ, ON THE MONT PARMELAN, NEAR
ANNECY.</h3>

<p>We started southwards from the Glaci&egrave;re of <i>Grand Anu</i>, for
such they said was the proper name for the cave last described, and passed
over some of the wildest walking I have seen. All the most striking
features of a glacier were here reproduced in stone: now narrow deep
crevasses which only required a slight spring; now much more formidable
rents, which we were obliged to circumvent by a d&eacute;tour; now dark
mysterious holes with vertical shell-like partitions at various depths;
and now a perfect <i>moulin</i>, with fluted sides and every detail
appertaining to those remarkable pits, the hollow plunge of falling water
alone excepted. In other parts, the smooth slab-like appearance of the
surface reminded me of a curious district on one of the summits of the
Jura, where the French frontier takes the line of crest, and the old
stones marked with the <i>fleur-de-lys</i> and the Helvetic cross are
still to be found. In those border regions the old historic distinctions
are still remembered, and the frontier Vaudois call the neighbouring
French <i>Bourguignons</i>--or, in their patois, <i>Borgognons</i>. They
keep up the tradition of old hatreds; and the strange bleak summit, with
its smooth slabs of Jura-chalk lying level with the surface, is so much
like a vast cemetery, that the wish in old times has been father to the
thought, and they call it still the Cemetery of the Burgundians, <i>
Cimetiros ai Borgognons</i>.<a name="FNanchor73"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Page_183"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;183]</span></a>

<p>After a time, we reached a tumbled chaos of rock, much resembling the
ice-fall of a glacier, and, on descending, and rounding a low spur of the
mountain so as to take a north-westerly course, we found ourselves in a
perfect paradise of flowers. One orchis I shall always regret. There
seemed to be only a single head, closely packed with flowerets, and
strongly scented; it was a pure white, not the green and straw-coloured
white of other scented orchises. There were large patches of the delicate
<i>faux-lis (Paradisia liliastrum)</i>; and though there might not be
anything very rare, and the lovely glacier-flowers were of course wanting,
the whole was a rich feast for anyone who cares more for delicacy and
colour than for botany.</p>

<p>The maire told us that he had found the glaci&egrave;re, for which we
were now in search, two years before, when he accompanied the government
surveyor to show him the forests and mountains which formed his property.
As he had on that occasion approached the spot from the other side, we
walked a long way to place him exactly where the surveyor and he had
crossed the ridge of the mountain, and then started him down from the Col
in the direction they had taken. He was certain of two things: first, that
they had passed by the Col between the Mont Parmelan and the Montagne de
l'Eau; and, secondly, that the glaci&egrave;re was within five minutes of
the highest point of the Col. For three-quarters of an hour we all broke
our shins, and the officials the Third Commandment. They invoked more
saints than I had ever heard of, and, in default, did not scruple to
appeal with shocking volubility to darker aid. It was all of no use,--and
well it might be; for when we had given it up in despair, after long
patience and a considerable period of the contrary, and had descended for
half an hour in the direction of a third glaci&egrave;re, I chanced to
look back, and <a name="Page_184"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;184]</span></a> saw that the Col in the neighbourhood of which
we had been searching lay between two points of the Montagne de l'Eau;
while the true Col between that mountain and the Mont Parmelan lay
considerably to the west. When it appears that a guide has probably made a
mistake, the only plan is to assume quietly that it is so, as if it were a
matter of no consequence, and then he may sometimes be decoyed into
allowing the fact: I therefore pointed out to the maire the true Col, and
told him that was the one by which he had passed southwards, when he found
the glaci&egrave;re; to which, with unnecessary strength of language, he
at once assented. But all my efforts to take him back were unavailing.
Nothing in the world should carry him up the mountain again, now that he
had happily got so far down. I worked his best and his worst feelings with
equal want of success; even national jealousy failed, and he was content
to know that a French maire had not pluck to face three-quarters of an
hour of climbing, when an English priest was ready to lead the way. The
schoolmaster declined to go alone with me, on the ground that neither of
us knew the mountain, and threatening clouds were gathering all around.
When, at last, I proposed to go by myself, they became menacingly
obstructive, and declared that I should certainly not be allowed to face
the intricacy of the mountain in a fog. Besides, as the maire put it, he
was sure of the way to the third glaci&egrave;re; and if I were to go up
alone to look for the second, I should lose a certainty for a chance, as
there was not time to visit both. So with an ill grace I continued the
descent with them, being restored to good humour before long by the beauty
of the Lake of Annecy, as seen from our elevated position.</p>

<p>It is so impossible to accept in full the accounts one picks up of
natural curiosities, that I give the maire's description of the stray
glaci&egrave;re only for what it is worth. It was not extracted without
much <a name="Page_185"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;185]</span></a>
laborious cross-examination--<i>sais paw vous le dire</i> being the
average answer to my questions. The entrance to the cave is about twice as
high as a man, and is in a small shallow basin of rock and grass. The
floor is level with the entrance, and the roof rises inside to a good
height. In shape it is like a Continental bread-oven; and at the time of
the maire's visit, the floor was a confused mass of ice and stones, the
former commencing at the very entrance. There was no ice except on the
floor, the area of which might be as large as that of the surface of the
ice in the Glaci&egrave;re of Grand Anu. No pit was to be seen, and not a
drop of water. Snow could have drifted in easily, but they saw no signs of
any remaining. If this account be true, especially with respect to the
position of the entrance and the horizontal direction of the floor, I have
seen no glaci&egrave;re like it.</p>

<p>We descended for a time through fir-woods, and then again down steep
and barren rocks, till we reached the sharp slope of grass which so
frequently connects the base of a mountain with the more civilised forests
and the pasturages below. The maire led us for some distance along the top
of this grass slope, towards the west, skirting the rocks till they became
precipitous and lofty, when he said we must be near our point. Still we
went on and on without seeing any signs of it, and our guide seemed in
despair; and I, for one, entirely gave up the third cave to the same fate
as the second, and became very sulky and remonstrative. The entrance to
the glaci&egrave;re, the maire told us, was a hole in the face of the
highest rocks, 3 or 4 yards only above the grass; and as we had now
reached a part of the mountain where the rock springs up smooth and high,
and we could command the whole face, and yet saw nothing, the schoolmaster
came over to my side, and told the maire he was a humbug. However, we were
then within a few yards of the desired <a name="Page_186"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;186]</span></a> spot, and half-a-dozen steps showed
us a small <i>chemin&eacute;e</i>, down which a strong and icy current of
wind blew. The maire shouted a shout of triumph, and climbed the <i>
chemin&eacute;e</i>; and when we also had done the necessary gymnastics,
we found a hole facing almost due north, all within being dark. The
current blew so determinedly, that matches were of no use, and I was
obliged to seek a sheltered corner before I could light a candle; and,
when lighted, the candle was with difficulty kept from being blown out. No
ice was visible, nor any signs of such a thing,--nothing but a very
irregular narrow cave, with darkness at the farther end. As we advanced,
we found that the floor of the cave came to a sudden end, and the darkness
developed into a strange narrow fissure, which reached out of sight
upwards, and out of sight below; and down this the maire rolled stones,
saying that <i>there</i> was the glaci&egrave;re, if only one could get at
it without a <i>tourneau</i>. Considering the persistency with which he
had throughout declared that there was no possible need for a rope, I gave
him some of my mind here, in that softened style which his official
dignity demanded; but he excused himself by saying that the gentleman who
owned the glaci&egrave;re, and extracted the ice for private use only, was
now living at his summer ch&acirc;let, a mile or two off, and he, the
maire, had felt confident that the <i>tourneau</i> would have been fitted
up for the season.</p>

<p>On letting a candle down from the termination of the floor, we found
that the perpendicular drop was not more than 12 feet, and from the shelf
thus reached it seemed very possible to descend to the farther depths of
the fissure; but I had become so sceptical, that I persisted in asserting
that there was no ice below. The maire's manner, also, was strange, and I
suspected that the cold current of air had caused the place to be called a
glaci&egrave;re, with any other qualification on the part <a name=
"Page_187"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;187]</span></a> of the cave.
One thing was evident,--no snow could reach the fissure. M. M&eacute;trai
was determined that I must not attempt the descent, pointing out, what was
quite true, that though the fall was not great, there seemed no
possibility of getting back up the smooth rock. His arguments increased my
suspicions; so, leaving all apparatus behind, I dropped down to join the
candle, rather hoping to have the satisfaction of sending them off for a
rope, in case I could not achieve the last few feet in returning, and
knowing that there was no danger of the fate which once threatened the
chamois-hunting Kaiser Max.<a name="FNanchor74"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p>The drop turned out to be a mere nothing, and, taking the candle, I
scrambled on, down the sloping floor of the fissure, towards the heart of
the mountain, expecting every moment that my further passage would be
stopped by solid rock. But, after reaching a part so narrow that I was
obliged to mount by both sides at once in order to get past it, I found a
commodious gallery, opening out into a long and narrow and very lofty
cavern, still only a fissure, the floor of which continued the regular and
rapid slope down which I had so far come. A short way farther down, an
opening appeared to the left; and I turned off the main passage into a
horizontal gallery or chamber, with a floor of ice resting on rock and
stones. This chamber seemed to be 3 or 4 yards wide at the entrance,
narrowing regularly to 4 1/2 feet. It was 40 feet long, and at the farther
end, which would not have been visible from the entrance, on account of a
slight bend in the ice-gallery, even if there had been any light, it was
closed by an ice-cascade 7 yards high and 4 1/2 feet broad at the bottom.
The ice of much of this cascade was so clear, that I saw <a name=
"Page_188"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;188]</span></a> the rock upon
which it rested, or in some parts did not rest, quite plainly, and the
large air-cavities in the structure were beautifully shown by the
richly-coloured rock behind. None of the current which we had observed
above, and which had nearly baffled my protecting care of the candle
during the descent, came from this gallery; but I find it written in my
notes that the gallery was <i>very</i> cold. Thaw was going on, rather
rapidly; and the water stole out by the entrance, and ran down the main
descent, over ice and among rocks, into the farther darkness.</p>

<p>When I came out again from this gallery, I mounted the slope towards my
companions, and tried to tempt them down. The maire felt himself to be too
valuable to his country to be lightly risked, and declined to come; but
Rosset took a bold heart, and dropped, after requiring from me a solemn
promise that I would give him a back for his return up the rock. We
visited the gallery I had already explored, and, as we stood admiring the
cascade of ice, a skilful drop of water came from somewhere, and
extinguished our only candle. My matches were with the maire; and I was
equally sure that he would not bring them down to us, and that we could
not go up to fetch them without a light. Rosset, however, very
fortunately, had a box in his pocket for smoking purposes; and we cut off
the wet wick, and cut down the composition to form another, and so
contrived to light the candle again. While we were thus engaged, I chanced
to look up for a moment, and saw far above our heads a small opening in
the roof, through which a few rays of light entered from the outer world.
It was so very far above us, that the uncertain rays were lost long before
they got down to our level, being absorbed in the universal darkness, and
being in fact rather suggested than visible even at their strongest. Those
who have been at Lauterbrunnen in a very dry season, will understand how
these rays presented the appearance of a <a name="Page_189"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;189]</span></a> ghostly Staubbach of unreal light. We
must have been at an immense depth below the surface in which the opening
lay; and if there had been a long day before us, it would have been
curious to search for the fissure above. Sir Thomas Browne says, in the
<i>Religio Medici,</i> 'Conceive light invisible, and that is a spirit.'
We very nearly saw a spirit here.</p>

<p>The descent from the mouth of this chamber to the deeper recesses of
the main fissure was very rough, but was speedily accomplished, and we
reached a point where solid rock stopped us in face; while, to the right,
a chamber with a threshold of ice was visible, and, to the left, a dark
opening, down which the descent appeared to continue. From this opening
all the strong cold current came. We took the ice-chamber first.</p>

<p>The entrance had evidently been closed till very lately by a large
column of ice, and we passed over the d&eacute;bris, between rock portals
and on a floor of solid grey ice, into a triangular cave of any height the
imagination might choose to fix. The entire floor of the cave was of ice,
giving the impression of infinite thickness and firmness. A little water
stood on it, near the threshold, so limpid that we could not see where it
commenced. The base of this triangular floor we found to be 17 feet, and
its altitude 30 feet; and though these dimensions may seem comparatively
small, the whole effect of the thick mass of ice on which we stood, with
the cascades of ice in the corners, and the ice-figures on the walls, and
the three sides of the cave passing up into sheer darkness, was
exceedingly striking, situated, as it all was, so deep down in the bowels
of the earth. The original entrance to the fissure, at the top of the <i>
chemin&eacute;e</i>, was, as has been said, at the base of <a name=
"Page_190"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;190]</span></a> lofty rocks,
and we had descended very considerably from the entrance; so that, even
without the strange light thrown upon the matter by the small hole
overhead, through which we had seen the day struggling to force its way
into the cavern, we should have been sure that we were now at an immense
distance below the surface. One corner of the cave was occupied by a broad
and solid-looking cascade, while another corner showed the opening of a
very narrow fissure, curved like one of the shell-shaped crevasses of a
glacier. Into this fissure the ice-floor streamed; and Rosset held my
coat-tails while I made a few steps down the stream, when the fall became
too rapid for further voluntary progress. I let down a stone for 18 feet,
when it stuck fast, and would move neither one way nor the other. The
upper wall of this fissure was clothed with moss-like ice, and ice of the
prismatic structure,--with here and there large scythe-blades, as it were,
attached by the sharp edge to the rock, and lying vertically with the heel
outwards. One of these was 11 inches deep, from the heel to the rock, and
only one-eighth of an inch thick at the thickest part.</p>

<p>The angle occupied by the cascade or column was the most striking. The
base of the column was large, and apparently solid, like a smooth unbroken
waterfall suddenly frozen. It fitted into the angle of the cave, and
completely filled up the space between the contiguous walls. I commenced
to chop with my axe, and before long found that this ice was hollow,
though very thick; and when a sufficient hole was made for me to get
through, I saw that what had looked like a column was in truth only a
curtain of ice hung across the angle of the cave. Within the curtain the
ice-floor still went on, streaming down at last into a fissure something
like that in the other corner. The curtain was so low, that I was obliged
to sit on the ice inside to explore; and after a foot or two <a name=
"Page_191"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;191]</span></a> of progress,
the slope towards the fissure became sufficiently great to require steps
to be cut. The stream of ice turned round a bend in the fissure, very near
the curtain, and was lost to view; but Rosset stood by the hole through
which I had passed--on the safer side of it--and despatched blocks of ice,
which glided past me round the corner, and went whizzing on for a long
time, eventually landing upon stones, and sometimes, we fancied, in water.
It is very awkward work, sitting on a gentle slope of the smoothest
possible ice, with a candle in one hand, and an axe in the other, cutting
each step in front; especially when there is nothing whatever to hold by,
and the slope is sufficient to make it morally certain that in case of a
slip all must go together. Of course, a rope would have made all safe.
When I groaned over the maire's obstinacy, Rosset asked what could
possibly be the use of a rope, if I were to slip; and, to my surprise, I
found that he had no idea what I wanted a rope for. When he learned that,
had there been one, he would have played a large part in the adventure,
and that he might have had me dangling over an ice-fall out of sight round
the corner, he added his groans to mine, and would evidently have enjoyed
it all very much. At the same time, he was prudent, and, as each block of
ice made its final plunge, he told me that was what would happen to me if
I went any farther: and, really, the pictures he drew of deep lakes of icy
water and jagged points of rock, between which I must make my choice down
there, were so unpleasant, that at last I desisted, and pushed myself up
backwards, still in a sitting posture, calling Rosset and the maire the
worst names I could feel justified in using. On the way, I found one of
the large brown flies which we had seen in the Glaci&egrave;re of La
Genolli&egrave;re, and in the Lower Glaci&egrave;re of the Pr&eacute; de
S. Livres.</p>

<a name="Page_192"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;192]</span></a>

<p>Rosset now told me he was so cold he could stand it no longer; but,
after a little pressure, and a declaration on my part that he should not
have a candle for going up again, he consented to remain with me while I
explored the remaining chamber, the lowest of all. This chamber may be
called a continuation of the main passage. It is of about the same width
as the highest of the three chambers, and the floor descends rapidly, the
cold current of air becoming very strong and biting as we penetrated into
the darkness. As the Genevese <i>savans</i> seemed to believe in 'cold
currents' as the cause of underground ice, I was naturally anxious to see
as much as possible of the state of this gallery, from which every
particle of the current seemed to come. We very soon reached a narrow dark
lake, and, exclaiming that here was ice again, I stepped, not on to, but
into it, and found that it was water. When our solitary candle was brought
to bear upon it, we saw that it was so clear as not in any way to impede
our view, producing rather the effect of slightly-clouded spectacles upon
the stones at the bottom. This lake filled up the whole breadth of the
gallery, here perhaps 4 or 5 feet, and rapidly passed to the depth of a
yard; but for a little distance there were unstable stones at one edge,
and steps in the rock-wall, by which I could pass on still into the
darkness, supported by an alpenstock planted in the water. The current of
cold air blew along the surface of the water from the farther extremity of
the gallery, wherever that might be. As far as our eyes could reach, we
saw nothing but the black channel of water, with its precipitous sides
passing up beyond our sight. It might have been possible to progress in a
spread-eagle fashion, with one hand and one foot on each side; but a fall
would have been so bitterly unpleasant, that I made a show of
condescension in acceding to Rosset's request that I would not attempt
such a thing. In the course of my <a name="Page_193"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;193]</span></a> return to the rocks where he stood, I
involuntarily fathomed the depth of the lake, luckily in a shallower part,
and was so much struck by the coldness of the water, that I left Rosset
with the candle, and struggled up without a light to the place where we
had left the maire, or rather to the bottom of the drop from the
entrance-cave, to get the thermometer. The maire was sunning himself on
the rock, out of reach of the cold current; but he came in, and let down
the case, and I quickly rejoined the schoolmaster. At first, it would have
been impossible to move about without a light; but our eyes had now become
to some extent accustomed to the darkness, and I had learned the
difficulties of the way.</p>

<p>When the thermometers were suspended in the water, Rosset asked how
long they must stay there. I rashly answered, a quarter of an hour; on
which he demanded indignantly whether I supposed he meant to stay in that
cold for a quarter of an hour. He had now the candle in his own
possession, and I was propped on a stone and an alpenstock in the lake, so
he turned to go, vowing that he would leave me alone in the dark if I did
not come out at once. There was no help for it, as the thermometer would
have been of no use without a candle, and a step in the dark is not
pleasant when all around is water, so I slowly drew up the thermometer and
read 33&deg; F. In making final arrangements for departure, I let it lie
in the water for a few seconds longer, and it fell to 32&frac12;&deg;; but
Rosset would not stay a moment longer, and I was obliged to be content
with that result. He made himself very easy about the matter, and said we
must call it zero; and in the evening I heard him telling the maire that
the greatest of the wonders he had missed, by his patriotic care for his
neck, was a lake of water which did not freeze, though its temperature was
zero (centigrade).</p>

<a name="Page_194"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;194]</span></a>

<p>Among the stones at the bottom of this water, I saw here and there
patches of a furry sort of ice. I have often watched the freezing of a
rapid Scotch stream, where, in the swifter parts, the ice forms first at
the bottom and gradually creeps up the larger stones till it appears on
the surface, and becomes a nucleus, round which pieces of floating ice
collect; and the substance in the glaci&egrave;re-lake had exactly the
same appearance as the Scotch ground-ice. But it could not be the same
thing in reality, for, as far as I understand the phenomenon of
ground-ice, some disturbed motion of the water is necessary, to drive down
below the surface the cold particles of water, which become ice the moment
they strike upon any solid substance shaped like fractured stone;<a name=
"FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> the specific
gravity of freezing water being so much less than that of water at a
somewhat higher temperature, that without some disturbing cause it would
not sink to the bottom.<a name="FNanchor76"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> So that it seems probable that the ice
at the bottom of the lake was the remains of a solid mass, of which the
greater part had been converted into water by some warm influence or
other. We noticed that a little water trickled down among the stones which
formed the slope of descent into the lowest gallery, so that perhaps the
lake was a collection of water from all parts of the various ramifications
of the fissure. Whence came the icy wind, it is impossible to say, without
further exploration. It was satisfactory to me to find that the 'cold
current' of the Genevese <i>savans</i> was thus associated with water, and
not with ice, in the only cave in which I had detected its presence to any
appreciable extent, the currents of the Glaci&egrave;re of Month&eacute;zy
being of a totally different description.</p>

<a name="Page_195"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;195]</span></a>

<p>When we reached the final rock, in ascending, I offered Rosset the
promised back, but he got up well enough without it. Before leaving the
entrance-cave, we inspected the thermometer which we had left to test the
temperature of the current of air, and, to my surprise, found it standing
at 48&deg;. We saw, however, that it had been carelessly propped on a
piece of rock which sheltered it from the influence of the current, so I
exposed it during the time occupied in arranging the bag of tapes, &amp;c.,
and it fell to 36&deg;: whether it would have fallen lower, the impatience
of Rosset has left me unable to say. If I can ever make an opportunity for
visiting the Mont Parmelan again, I shall hope to take a cord, in order to
investigate the mysterious corner of the triangular chamber; and I shall
certainly make myself independent of shivering Frenchmen while I measure
the temperature of the lake and the current of air. We met a man outside
who said that he was employed by the owner, M. de Chosal of Annecy, to cut
the ice; he had been down three times to the lowest gallery in different
years, in the end of July, and had always found the same collection of
water there. The glaci&egrave;re, he told us, was discovered about thirty
years ago.</p>

<p>The maire had basked in the sun all the time we were down below, and he
expressed himself as much pleased that we had found so much to interest
us, in spite of the miscarriage of our efforts to reach the second
glaci&egrave;re. We set off down the steep grass at a scrambling sliding
run, against which I was speedily obliged to protest, explaining that a
certain ugly inflammation above the left knee was becoming worse every
other step, and as the leg must last three days longer, it would be as
well to humour it. They saw the force of this reasoning, and we descended
with much gravity till we came in sight of the <i>Mairie</i>, still half
an hour off, when Rosset cried out that he <a name="Page_196"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;196]</span></a> smelled supper, and rushed off at an
infectious pace down the remainder of the mountain-side.</p>

<p>We reached the <i>Mairie</i> at six o'clock, and sat down at once 'to
eat something.' The first course was bread and kirsch; and when that was
finished, six boiled eggs appeared, and a quart <i>carafe</i> of white
wine. These having vanished, their place was taken by a dish of sodden
cabbage, and another quart of wine; but, to save the credit of the maire
and the schoolmaster, I will not say how often the former functionary
descended to the cellar with a quart pitcher, with increasing impetuosity.
Next came a dish of onions, with a pretence of <i>mange-tout,</i> broiled
brown after boiling, and served in a compound fat; and then haricots with
a like condiment, and with a flavour reminiscent of the previous course.
There was some talk of a <i>poulet</i>; but the bird still lived, and the
talk came to nothing. The dinner ended with the haricots, and we then
relapsed into dessert, namely, bread and kirsch. The mayoress came in with
the dessert, and sat on the end of the bench, below the hats and the
bread-tin, eating the remaining onions off the dish with the spoon of
nature.</p>

<p>During one of the maire's frequent visits to the cellar, I propounded a
question to the schoolmaster which had puzzled me for some time: Was I to
pay the maire? M. Rosset said that it was certainly not <i>necessary</i>,
but I had better propose it, and I should then see how M. M&eacute;tral
took it. This I accordingly did, when the adieux in the house had been
said, and my host was showing me the way to Thorens, where I was to sleep,
he, also, declared that it was not necessary--the pleasure he had
experienced in accompanying me had already fully recompensed him: still,
if I wished to reimburse him for that which I had actually cost, he was a
man reasonable, and in all cases content. I calculated that the dinner and
wine which had <a name="Page_197"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;197]</span></a> fallen to my share would be dear at a franc,
and the day's wage of a substitute to do the maire's neglected work could
not come to much, so I boldly and unblushingly gave that great man four
francs, and he said regretfully that it was more than enough. To his son
and heir--the identical boy who had brought the ring of bread up the
mountain to the chalet where we lunched. I gave something under two-pence,
for guiding me across two doubtful fields into a beaten track, and he
expressed himself as even more content than the maire. They both told me
that it was impossible to miss the way; but I imagine that I achieved that
impossibility, as I had to walk through two streams in the deepening
twilight, and the prevailing fear of water in that region is very
considerable.</p>

<p>The <i>auberge</i> at Thorens to which the maire had recommended me, as
being the best, and kept by a personal friend of his, bore the sign <i>
&agrave; la Parfaite Union</i>. The entry was by the kitchen, and through
the steam and odour of onions, illuminated by one doubtful oil-lamp, I saw
the guest-room filled with people in Sunday dress, while two fiddles
played each its own tune in its own time. Nothing but the potent name of
M. the Maire of Aviernoz gained me even a hearing; and, for a bed, I was
obliged to stretch my intimacy with that exalted personage to the very
furthest bounds of truth. Chappaz Nicolai, whose name the maire had
written in my note-book, that there might be no mistake, appeared to be of
that peculiar mental calibre which warrants Yorkshire peasants in
describing a man as 'half-rocked,' or 'not plumb.' His wife, on the other
hand, was one of those neat, gentle, sensible women, of whom one wonders
how they ever came to marry such thick-lipped and blear-eyed men. Between
them they informed me that if I did not object to share a room, I could be
taken in; otherwise--maire or no maire--not. I asked <a name="Page_198">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;198]</span></a> whether they meant half a
bed; but they said no, that would not be necessary at present; and I
accepted the offered moiety of accommodation, as it was now seventeen
hours since I had started in the morning, and I was not inclined to turn
out in the dark to look for a whole room elsewhere.</p>

<p>The stairs were a sort of cross between a ladder and nothing, and when
we reached the proposed room a large mastiff was in possession, who would
not let us enter till the master was summoned to expel him. The furniture
consisted of a table and five chairs, with no bed or beds. On the chairs
were various articles of clothing, blouses and garments more profound,
belonging probably to members of the party below; and on the table, a
bottle of water and a soup-plate, the pitcher and basin of the house. It
was a mere slip of a room, with two diamond-shaped holes in one wall,
whose purpose I discovered when my guide opened a papered door, in which
were the holes, and displayed two beds foot to foot in an alcove. One of
these, she was sure, would be too short for me, but she feared I must be
satisfied with it, as the other was much broader and would therefore hold
the two messieurs. How the <i>two</i>? I asked, and was told that two <i>
pensionnaires</i> lived in this room; but they were old friends, and for
one night would sleep in the same bed to oblige monsieur. The ideas of
length and breadth in connection with the beds were entirely driven from
my head by the fact of their dirtiness; and I determined that if the two
<i>pensionnaires</i> occupied the one, the other should be unoccupied.</p>

<p>After arranging things a little, I struggled down the steps again, and
ordered coffee and bread in a little room, which commanded the assembly
with the fiddles in the larger <i>salle</i>. The head waitress, busy as
she was, found time to come now and then to an open window near where I
sat, <a name="Page_199"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;199]</span></a>
and talked to a male friend sitting outside in the dark: indeed, she did
more than talk, and people had to rattle their glasses very hard before
they could make her hear. From her I learned that this was a marriage
party which had arrived; and when I asked why they did not dance, as the
fiddles were engaged at that moment with unwonted unanimity upon
dance-music, she gave me to understand that these were not people of
Thorens, but only a party from another village, making the evening
promenade after the wedding: from which it would seem that it is not the
etiquette for people to dance under such circumstances, except in the home
village. They sat round a table, men and women alternately, with their
hats on, and with glasses before them. The bride and bridegroom were
accommodated with a bench to themselves at the head of the table, he
likewise with his hat on, and with a pipe in his mouth, which, seeing that
he was a demonstrative bridegroom, one might have supposed to be an
inconvenience. He managed very well, however, and every one seemed
contented: indeed, the pipe must, I think, be held to be no difficulty;
for the men all smoked, and yet, to judge from appearances, there was a
prospect of as many marriages as there were couples in the room. The
unruffled gravity, however, and the apparent want of zest, both in giving
and receiving, which characterised the proceedings specially referred to,
led me to suppose that it might be only a part of the etiquette, and so
meant nothing serious.</p>

<p>Between ten and eleven the fiddles and the party vanished, and I went
up-stairs more determined than ever not to touch a bed, after my
experience of the room below. Three chairs were speedily arranged between
the table and wall, and on these I lay and tried to sleep. But the very
chairs were populous, as I had found below, and sleep was impossible.
Moreover, soon after eleven, a soldier came into the room, to arrange
about his <a name="Page_200"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;200]</span></a> breakfast with one of the maidens in the house.
He had heard me order fresh butter for six o'clock, and he was anxious to
know, whether, by breakfasting at five o'clock, he could get my butter.
The chairs which formed my bed were under the lee of the table, so that
the figure recumbent on them was invisible, and the gallant soldier, under
the impression that there was no one in the room, enforced his arguments
by other than conventional means. But military lips, when applied
personally, proved to be a rhetoric as unsuccessful as military words. The
maid was platonic, and something more than platonic; and the hero got so
much the worst of it, that he gave up the battle, and changed the subject
to a conscript in his charge, who had locked himself in his bed-room and
would not answer. How was he to know whether he had the conscript safe?
All this lasted some time; and when they were gone, one of the <i>
pensionnaires</i> came in. With him I had to fight the battle of the
window, which I had opened to its farthest extent. After he had got over
the first surprise and shock of finding me on the chairs instead of in the
bed, for whose comfort he vouched enthusiastically, he became confident
that it was merely out of complaisance to him and his comrade that I had
opened the window, and assured me that they really did not care for fresh
air, even if they could feel the difference in the alcove, which he
declared they could not. As soon as that was arranged to my satisfaction,
the other <i>pensionnaire</i> came in, and with him the battle was fought
with only half success, for he peremptorily closed one side of the window.
He was a particularly noisy <i>pensionnaire</i>, and shied his boots into
every corner of the room before they were posed to his satisfaction. As
far as I could tell, the removal of the boots was the only washing and
undressing either of them did; and then they arranged their candles in the
alcove, lighted cigars, and got into bed. <a name="Page_201"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;201]</span></a> There the wretches sat up on end,
smoking and talking vehemently, till sheer exhaustion came to my aid, and
I fell asleep; but the edges of the rush-bottomed chairs speedily became
so sharp that a recumbent posture ceased to be possible, and I sat dozing
on one chair. A little before four o'clock, the noisier man got up to look
for his boots; and as the friends continued their discussion, I also
turned out and made for the nearest stream, where I bathed in a rapid at
half-past four, to wash away, if possible, the horrors of the night.</p>

<a name="Page_202"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;202]</span></a>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RES OF THE BREZON, AND THE VALLEY OF REPOSOIR.</h3>

<p>The bill <i>&agrave; la Parfaite Union</i> was as small as the
accommodation at that <i>auberge</i>, and it was an immense relief to get
away from the scene of my sufferings. The path to Bonneville lies for the
earlier part of the way through pleasant scenery; and when the highest
ground is reached, there is a lovely view of the Lake of Geneva, which may
be enjoyed under the cool shade of a high hedge of trees, in the intervals
of browsing upon wild strawberries. But after passing the curious old town
of La Roche, two hours' walk from Thorens, the heat and dust of the dreary
high road became insupportable; and no pedestrian who undertakes that
march with a heavy knapsack, under a blazing noonday sun, will arrive at
Bonneville without infinite thankfulness that he has got through it. The
road is of the same character as that between Bonneville and Geneva, and
that will sufficiently express its unpleasantness in baking times of
drought.</p>

<p>The Glaci&egrave;re of the Brezon lies at no great distance from
Bonneville--perhaps not more than four or five miles to the SE.--but its
elevation is more than 4,000 feet, and the approach is steep. The
Glaci&egrave;re of the Valley of Reposoir, a valley which falls into the
main road between Bonneville and Chamouni at the village of Scionzier, is
considerably higher, and a good deal of climbing is necessary in visiting
it. When I arrived at Bonneville, the whole mass of mountains <a name=
"Page_203"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;203]</span></a> in which these
caves lie was enveloped in thick dark clouds, and the faint roar of
thunder reached our ears now and then, so that it seemed useless to
attempt to penetrate into the high valleys. Moreover, I was due for an
attempt upon Mont Blanc in the beginning of the next week, and an
incipient bilious fever, with a painful lameness of one leg, warned me
that my powers were coming to an end, and that another day such as the
last had been would put a total stop upon the proposed ascent; and so I
determined to take the fever and the leg to Geneva, and submit them to
medical skill. This determination was strengthened by the exhortations of
a Belgian, who called himself a <i>grand amateurdes montagnes</i>, on the
strength of an ascent of the M&ocirc;le and the Voiron, and in this
character administered Alpine advice of that delightful description which
one meets with in the coffee-rooms at Chamouni. This Belgian was the only
other guest of the H&ocirc;tel des Balances; and his amiability was proof
even against the inroads of some nameless species of <i>vin mousseux</i>,
recommended to me by the waiter, which supplied <i>mal-&agrave;-propos</i>
wine-sauce to the various dishes from which the Belgian was making his
dinner, and did not leave his face and waistcoat free from stain. He had
but one remark to make, however wild might be the assertions advanced from
the English side of the table, '<i>Vous avez raison, monsieur, vous avez
parfait-e-ment raison</i>!' It is not quite satisfactory to hold the same
sentiments, in every small particular, with a man who clips his hair down
to a quarter of an inch, and eats haricots with his fingers; but it was
impossible to find any subject on which he could be roused to
dissentience. This phenomenon was explained afterwards, when he informed
me that he was a flannel-merchant travelling with samples, and pointed out
what was only too true, namely, that the English monsieur's coat was no
longer fit to be called a coat. <a name="Page_204"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;204]</span></a></p>

<p>Professor Pictet read a paper on these glaci&egrave;res before the <i>
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Helv&eacute;tique des Sciences Naturelles</i> at
Berne, in 1822, which is to be found in the <i>Bibl. Universelle de
Gen&egrave;ve.</i><a name="FNanchor77"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> M. Pictet left Geneva in the middle of
July to visit the caves, but found himself so much knocked up by the first
day's work, that he sent on his grandson to the Glaci&egrave;re of the
Brezon, and gave up the attempt himself. The young man found it to be of
small dimensions, 30 feet by 25, with a height of 10 or 12 feet. The ice
on the floor was believed by the guide to be formed in summer only, and
was placed too irregularly to admit of measurement. Calcareous blocks
almost choked the entrance, and an orifice in the shape of a funnel
admitted the snow freely from above, and was partly filled with snow in
July. Cold currents of air proceeded from the rocks in the neighbourhood
of the glaci&egrave;re, giving in one instance a temperature of
38&deg;&middot;75, the temperature in the shade being 51&deg;. Within the
cave, the temperature was 41&deg;.</p>

<p>M. Morin visited this glaci&egrave;re in August 1828. He describes it
as a sheltered hole, in which the snow collects and is preserved.</p>

<p>M. Thury examined it in August 1859, and gives the same account. He,
too, found the current of air which the younger Pictet discovered, but in
the cave itself the air was perfectly still.</p>

<p>It was clearly, then, no great loss to miss the Glaci&egrave;re of the
Brezon; but that on the Mont Vergy, in the Valley of Reposoir, appears to
be much more interesting. Professor Pictet found himself sufficiently
strong after a day's rest to pass on to Scionzier, and up the Valley of
Reposoir, accompanied by the well-known guide Timoth&eacute;e, whose
botanical <a name="Page_205"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;205]</span></a> knowledge of the district is said to be
perfect. He had conducted MM. Necker and Colladon to the glaci&egrave;re
in 1807, and believed that no <i>savant</i> had since seen it. The rocks
are all calcareous, with large blocks of erratic granite. The
glaci&egrave;re lies about 40 minutes from the Ch&acirc;let of Montarquis,
whence its local name of <i>La grand' Cave de Montarquis</i>. Before
reaching it, a spacious grotto presents itself, once the abode of coiners:
this grotto is cold, but affords no ice, and near it M. Morin found a
narrow fissure, leading into a circular vaulted chamber 15 feet in
diameter, in which stood a solitary stalagmite of ice 15 feet high.</p>

<p>The entrance to the glaci&egrave;re itself is elliptical in shape, 43
feet broad at the base, and the cave increases in size as it extends
farther into the rock, the floor descending gently till a horizontal
esplanade of ice is reached. This esplanade was 66 feet by 30 at the time
of Pictet's visit, deeper in the middle than at the sides, and mounting
the rock at the farther side of the cave; there was a small stalagmite at
one side, but that would seem to have been the only ornamentation
displayed. The temperature was 34&deg;&middot;7, a foot above the ice, and
58&deg; in the external air. Timoth&eacute;e had been in the
glaci&egrave;re in the previous April, and had found no ice,--nothing but
a pool of water of considerable depth. M. Thury, in August 1859, found two
sheets of ice in the lowest part of the cave: one, nearly 50 feet long,
was partially covered with water; the other, presenting an area of about
14 square yards, showed more water still. There were no stalactites and
columns such as M. Morin had found in August 1828, nor even the low
stalagmite which Pictet saw in 1822. The summers of 1828 and 1859 were
exceptionally hot, and this fact has been held to account for the smaller
quantity of ice seen in those years. M. Thury found the cold due <a name=
"Page_206"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;206]</span></a> to evaporation
to be considerably less than 1&deg; F.,<a name="FNanchor78"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> and he and M. Morin both fixed the
general temperature of the cave at 36&deg;&middot;5; they also found a
current of air entering by a fissure in the lowest part of the cave, but
it did not disturb the whole of the interior, for in one part the air was
in perfect equilibrium. M. Gampert,<a name="FNanchor79"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> in the summer of 1823, found a strong
and very cold current of air descending by this fissure, along with water
which ran from it over the ice; he believed that this was refrigerated by
evaporation, in passing through the thickness of the moist rock.</p>

<p>Two peasants visited this cave three times in the winter season, viz.
on October 22, November 26, and on Christmas Day; and one of them, by name
Chavan, drew up an account of their experiences, which was read by M.
Colladon before the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Physique et d'Histoire
Nat. de Gen&egrave;ve</i> in 1824.<a name="FNanchor80"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> The peasants found very little ice in
columns at the time of the October visit, and there were signs of
commencing thaw. The thaw was much more pronounced in November, when the
ice had nearly disappeared even from the lowest parts of the cave, and
they found the air within quite warm. On Christmas Day they had great
difficulty in reaching the glaci&egrave;re, and narrowly escaped
destruction by an avalanche, which for a time deterred them from
prosecuting the adventure: they persisted, however, and were rewarded by
finding only water where in summer all was ice, and a temperate warmth in
the cave. They observed that the roof had fissures like chimneys.</p>

<p>This account was so circumstantial, that the only thing left was to
attempt an explanation of the phenomena reported, and such explanations
have not been wanting. But M. Thury was not quite satisfied, and he
determined to visit the cave in the winter of 1860-1. Accordingly,
accompanied by M. Andr&eacute; Gindroz, who had already joined him in his
<a name="Page_207"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;207]</span></a>
unsuccessful attempt to reach the Glaci&egrave;re of the Pr&eacute; de S.
Livres, he left Geneva on the 10th of January, and slept at the Chartreuse
in the Valley of Reposoir. As the party passed through the village of
Pralong du Reposoir, the peasants told them with one accord that they
would find nothing but warmth and water in the cave; but when M. Thury
asked had any of them seen it themselves, they were equally unanimous in
saying no, explaining that it was not worth anyone's while to go in the
winter, as there was no ice to be seen then,--a circular line of argument
which did not commend itself to the strangers.</p>

<p>At the very entrance of the grotto, they found beautiful stalactites of
clear ice; and here they paused, till such time as they should be cool
enough to enter, for the thermometer stood at 70&deg; in the sun, and
their climb had made them hot. On penetrating to the farther recesses of
the cave, where the true glaci&egrave;re lies, they found an abundance of
stalactites, stalagmites, and columns of ice, with flooring and slopes of
the same material: not a drop of water anywhere. The stalagmites were very
numerous, but none of them more than three feet high; some of the
stalactites, fifteen or so in number, were six or seven feet long, and
there were many others of a smaller size. M. Thury was particularly struck
by the milky appearance of much of the ice, one column in particular
resembling porcelain more than any other substance. This is a not unusual
character of the most beautiful part of the decorations of the more
sheltered ice-caves, as for instance the lowest cave in the Upper
Glaci&egrave;re of the Pr&eacute; de S. Livres; the white appearance is
not due to the presence of air, for the ice is transparent and
homogeneous, and the naked eye is unable to detect bubbles or internal
fissures.</p>

<a name="Page_208"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;208]</span></a>

<p>The temperatures at 1.25 P.M. and 2.12 P.M. respectively were as
follows:--In the sun, between 3 and 4 feet above the snow,
72&deg;&middot;1 and 70&deg;&middot;5; in the shade, outside the cave,
36&deg;&middot;7 and 35&deg;&middot;8; at the Observatory of Geneva, in
the shade, 27&deg;&middot;3 and 28&deg;&middot;2, having risen from
24&deg;&middot;5 since noon. In the cave, 1 foot above the surface of the
ice-floor, the thermometer stood at 24&deg;&middot;8; and in a hole in the
ice, some few inches below the surface, 24&middot;1. In the large fissure,
which has been already mentioned as the source of the summer currents of
air, the temperature at various points was from 29&deg;&middot;3 to
27&middot;5. The circumstances of these currents of air were now of course
changed. Instead of a steady current passing from the fissure into the
cave, and so out by the main entrance into the open air, strong enough to
incline the flame of a candle 45&deg;, M. Thury found a gentle current
passing from the cave into the fissure, sufficient only to incline the
flame 10&deg;, and near the entrance 8&deg;, while in the entrance itself
no current was perceptible at 4 P.M.</p>

<p>M. Thury remarks that less current was to be expected in winter than in
summer, because the upper ends of the fissures would be probably choked
with snow, and their lower ends with ice. It is evident that the current
which passes up into the fissure in winter, is favourable to the
introduction of the colder air from without; while the opposite current in
summer keeps up a supply of cold air in the cave, and so increases its
powers of resisting the attempts of the heated external air to make a
partial entrance. Both these currents, then, favour the glacial conditions
of the cave, and to some extent counterbalance the disadvantages of its
situation: viz., its aspect, towards the south-east; the large size of its
opening to the air, and the absence of all shelter near the mouth, such as
is so often provided by trees or <a name="Page_209"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;209]</span></a> rocks. The small depth of the cave, scarcely
amounting to 18 feet below the level of the entrance, is also a great
disadvantage.</p>

<p>The people of Pralong asked, on the return of the party, what had been
found in the <i>grand' cave</i>, and the answer reduced them to silence
for a few moments. Their prejudices, however, were invincible, and they
persisted in their belief that a true glaci&egrave;re ought to have no ice
in it in the winter. M. Thury did not enquire from what source they drew
their ideas of a true glaci&egrave;re.</p>

<p>There is a book, in three volumes, on the 'Glaci&egrave;res of the
Alps,' by M. Bourrit, dedicated to Buffon, in which is a description of
the Valley of Reposoir; but no mention whatever is made of the <i>grand'
cave</i>. Indeed, M. Bourrit merely meant by <i>glaci&egrave;re</i>, a
glacial district, something more extensive than a <i>glacier</i>, and he
had evidently no knowledge of the existence of caves containing ice.</p>

<h3>LA BORNA DE LA GLACE, IN THE DUCHY OF AOSTA.</h3>

<p>The Chanoine Carrel, of Aosta, whose name is so well and so favourably
known to Alpine men, sent a brief account of an ice-cave in his
neighbourhood to the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Universelle</i> of Geneva<a
name="FNanchor81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> in the
year 1841, and, as far as I know, there is no other account of it. My plan
had been to pass from Chamouni by the Col du G&eacute;ant to Courmayeur,
and thence to Aosta for a visit to the canon and his glaci&egrave;re; but,
unfortunately, the symptoms which had put an end to the expedition to the
Brezon and the Valley of Reposoir came on with renewed vigour, as a
consequence of Mont Blanc, and the projected fortnight with Peter Pernn
collapsed into a hasty flight to Geneva. It was fortunate that medical
assistance was not necessary in Chamouni itself; for one of the members of
our large party there was mulcted in the sum of &pound;16, with a hint
that something beyond that would be acceptable, for an extremely moderate
amount of attendance by the local French doctor.</p>

<p>The glaci&egrave;re was thus of necessity given up. It is known among
the people as <i>La Borna de la Glace</i>, and lies about 5,300 feet above
the sea, on the northern slope of the hills which command the hamlet of
Chabaudey, commune of La Salle, in the duchy of Aosta, to the north-east
of Larsey-de-l&agrave;, in a place covered with firs and larches, and
called <a name="Page_211"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;211]</span></a>
Plan-agex. The entrance has an east exposure, and is very small, being a
triangle with a base of 2 feet and an altitude of 2-1/2 feet. After
descending a yard or two, this becomes larger, and divides into two main
branches, with three other fissures penetrating into the heart of the
mountain, too narrow to admit of a passage. The roof is very irregular,
and the stones on the floor are interspersed with ice, which appears also
in the form of icicles upon the walls; and, in the eastern branch of the
cave, there is a cylindrical pillar more than 3 feet long, with a diameter
of rather more than a foot. The temperature at 4 P.M. on July 15, 1841,
was as follows:--The external air, 59&deg;; the cave, at the entrance,
37&middot;2&ordm;; near the large cylinder, 35&deg;&middot;7; and in
different parts of the western branch, from 33&deg;&middot;6 to
32&deg;&middot;9.</p>

<p>M. Carrel was evidently not aware of the existence of similar caves
elsewhere. He recommends, in his communication to the <i>
Biblioth&egrave;que Universelle</i>, that some scientific man should
investigate the phenomena, and explain the great cold, and the fact of the
formation of ice, which common report ascribed to the time of the
Dog-days. He doubts whether rapid evaporation can be the only cause, and
suggests that possibly there may be something in the interior of the
mountain to account for this departure from the laws generally recognised
in geology.</p>

<h3>THE GLACI&Egrave;RE OF FONDEURLE, IN DAUPHIN&Eacute;.</h3>

<p>There cannot be any better place for recruiting strength than the
lovely primitive valley of <i>Les Plans</i>, two hours up the course of
the Aven&ccedil;on from hot and dusty Bex. Here I rejoined my sisters,
intending to spend a month with them before returning to England; and the
neighbouring glaciers afforded good opportunities for quietly
investigating the structure of the ice which composes them, with a view to
discovering, if possible, some trace of the prismatic formation so
universal in the glaci&egrave;res. On one occasion, after carefully
cutting steps and examining the faces of cleavage for an hour and a half,
I detected a small patch of ice, under the overhanging rim of a crevasse,
marked distinctly with the familiar network of lines on the surface; but I
was unable to discover anything betokening a prismatic condition of the
interior. This was the only case in which I saw the slightest approach to
the phenomena presented in ice-caves.</p>

<p>There remained one glaci&egrave;re on M. Thury's list, which I had so
far not thought of visiting. It was described as lying three leagues to
the north of Die in Dauphin&eacute;, department of the Dr&ocirc;me, at an
altitude of more than 5,000 feet above the sea. M. H&eacute;ricart de
Thury discovered this cavern in 1805, and published an account of it in
the <i>Annales des Mines</i><a name="FNanchor82"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> to which M. Thury's list gave a
reference. <a name="Page_213"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;213]</span></a> I have since found that this account has been
translated into various scientific periodicals, among others the
Philosophical Journal of Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor83"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a> earlier than I had intended, I could
take advantage of the new line connecting Chamb&eacute;ry and Grenoble and
Valence, and so visit this glaci&egrave;re without making the journey too
long; and accordingly I bade farewell to Madame Ch&eacute;rix's
comfortable room, leaving my sisters in their quarters in a neighbouring
ch&acirc;let, and started for Geneva.</p>

<p>The line was advertised to open on the 15th of August; but on the 16th
the officials declared that it was not within a month and a half of
completion, so that I was compelled to go round by Lyons. I was easily
reconciled to this by the opportunity thus afforded of a visit to the
ancient city of Vienne, which well repays inspection. Its history is a
perfect quarry of renowned names, Roman, Burgundian, and ecclesiastical.
Tiberius Gracchus left his mark upon the city, by bridling the
Rh&ocirc;ne--<i>impatiens pontis</i>--with the earliest bridge in Gaul:
and here tradition has it that the great Pompey loved magnificently one of
his many loves; while the site of the Pr&aelig;torium in which Pontius
Pilate is said to have given judgment can still be pointed out. The true
Mount Pilate lies between Vienne and Lyons, being one of the loftiest
northern summits of the Cevennes, on the borders of the Lyonnaise.<a name=
"FNanchor84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> The Romans
recognised the fitness of the neighbourhood of Vienne for the cultivation
of the grape, and the first vine in Gaul was planted on the Mont d'Or in
the second century of the Christian era. In Burgundian times the city held
a very prominent place, and became infamous from the frequent shedding of
royal blood; so that early historians describe it <a name="Page_214"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;214]</span></a> as '<i>tousiours fatale
&agrave; ceux qui vueillent la corone des Bourgougnons,'<a name=

Ecclesiastically, its interest dates of course from a very early period,
from the times of the martyrs of Gaul and the first Rogations. The
Festival of <i>Les Merveilles</i> long commemorated the restoration of the
bodily forms of the Lyonnese martyrs, as their scattered dust floated past
the home of Blandina and Ponticus; and the dedication of the cathedral to
S. Maurice keeps alive the tradition that Paschasius, bishop of Vienne,
was warned by an angel to watch on the banks of the Rh&ocirc;ne, and so
rescued the head and trunk of the soldier-martyr, which had been cast into
the river at Agaunum (S. Maurice in Valais), and had floated
down--probably on sounder hydrostatical principles than the 'Floating
Martyr'--through the Lake of Geneva, and so to Vienne. There are still
many very interesting Roman remains in the city, as the Temple of Augusta
and Livia, the Arcade of the Forum, and the monument seen from the railway
to the south of the town. The temple is being carefully restored, and the
large collection of Roman curiosities which it contained is to be removed
to the church of S. Peter, now in course of restoration, which will in
itself be worth a visit to Vienne when the restoration is completed.<a
name="FNanchor87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> All the
buildings connected with the Great Council in 1311 have disappeared; and
the only relic of the council seems to be the Chalice, <i>or</i>,
surmounted by the Sacred Host, <i>argent</i>, in the city arms, in
remembrance of the <a name="Page_215"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;215]</span></a> institution of the F&ecirc;te of the <i>S.
Corps</i>. If the Emperor would but have the town and its inhabitants
deodorised, few places would be better worth visiting than Vienne.</p>

<p>The poste leaves Valence--the home of the White Hermitage--for Die at
2.30 P.M., and professes to reach its destination in six hours; but sad
experience showed that it could be unfaithful to the extent of an hour and
a half. So long as the daylight lasted, there was no dearth of objects of
interest; but when darkness came on, the monotonous roll of the heavy
diligence became aggravating in the extreme. The village of Beaumont, once
the residence of an important branch of the great Beaumont family,<a name=
"FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> retains still
its square tower and old gateway; and the remains of a ch&acirc;teau near
Montmeyran, the end of the first stage, mark the scene of the victory of
Marius over the Ambrons and Teutons, local antiquaries believing that the
name of Montmeyran is from <i>Mons Jovis Mariani</i>.<a name=
"FNanchor89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> The road lies
through the bright cool green of wide plantations of the silkworm
mulberry,<a name="FNanchor90"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> with its trim stem and rounded head;
and, in the more open parts of the valley, walnut trees of size and shape
fit for an ornamental park in England relieve the monotony. The nearer
hills are covered to the top with vines, and the higher and more distant
ranges have a naked and thoroughly burned appearance, which suggests the
idea of volcanoes to a traveller ignorant of volcanic <a name="Page_216">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;216]</span></a> facts. The villages which
lie at the foot of these rocky hills are built of stones taken from the
beds of the streams, and are so completely of one colour with the
background of rock, that in many instances it is difficult to determine
whether a distant mass of grey is a village or not. Ruined castles and
towers abound; and these, and still more the walls which surround many of
the villages, point unmistakeably to times of great disturbance. The
valley of the Dr&ocirc;me, up which the road after a time turns, was an
important locality in the religious wars; and the town and fort of Crest
especially, as its name might suggest, was a famous stronghold, and
resisted all the efforts of the Reformed party. In yet earlier times,
Simon de Montfort had frequently tried to take it, without success; and
four years after S. Bartholomew, Lesdigui&egrave;res met with a like
repulse.<a name="FNanchor91"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> The same80 story of sieges and battles
might be told of almost every village and defile of the valley. Thus,
Saillans, the third stage, was taken by the Protestant leader Mirabel, and
the Catholic Gordes, in 1574, and its fortifications were razed by the Duc
de Mayenne in 1581. Pontaix, again, a remarkable place, with a vaulted
street and fortified houses overhanging the river, which here fills up the
whole valley and leaves room only for the road and the narrow
village-town, was the scene of an obstinate and murderous fight between
the Marquis de Gordes on one side, and Lesdigui&egrave;res and
Dupuy-Montbrun on the other, when the latter was captured, and shortly
after beheaded at Grenoble.</p>

<p>The town of Die, <i>Dea Vocontiorum</i>, lies in a broad part of the
valley. It claims to be not <i>Dea Vocontiorum</i> only, but also <i>
Augusta <a name="Page_217"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;217]</span></a> Vocontiorum</i>, thereby apparently defrauding
the village of Aouste, near Crest, of the earliest form of its name. Die
is possessed of old walls, and has four gates with towers. The great
goddess from whose worship it derives its name was Cybele, notwithstanding
the vehement assertions of the official in the Poste-bureau in favour of
Ceres; and three different Tauroboles have been discovered here, one of
which is in excellent repair, and shows a Roman inscription surmounted by
three bulls' heads. The ceremony of the Taurobolium was new to me, and
appears to have been conducted as follows:--A small cave was hollowed out,
with a thin roof formed by the outer surface of the earth; and immediately
above this a bull was sacrificed, so that the blood ran through the earth
and dropped on to a priest who was placed in full robes in the cave. The
priest and the blood-stained garments were thenceforth specially sacred,
the garments retaining their sanctity for twenty years. The inscription on
the Tauroboles which have been found in and near Die record the names of
the priest, the dendrophore, the person who provided the victim, and the
emperor for whose safety the sacrifice was offered.</p>

<p>The people of Die have been quarrelsome from the earliest times. A
century before the estates of the Dauphins of the Viennois were known as
Dauphin&eacute;,<a name="FNanchor92"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> the chronic contests between the
Bishops and the Counts of <a name="Page_218"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;218]</span></a> Die had come to such a crisis, that the Dauphin
Guiges Andr&eacute; intervened, and produced a certain amount of peace;
but, twenty years after, the people killed Bishop Humbert before the gate
which thence received its name of <i>Porte Rouge</i>. When the Counts of
Valentinois had succeeded to the fiefs of the Counts of Die, Gregory X.
became so weary of the constant wars, that he suppressed the bishopric,
and united it to Valence in 1275; but the canons, who were not suppressed,
raised a mercenary army and carried on the struggle. Eventually, the
canons and the people made common cause, and joined the Pope during the
Seventy Years; but when he left Avignon they came to terms with Charles
VI. of France, and so the Diois was united to Dauphin&eacute; in 1404.
Louis XIV. restored the separate bishopric, but ruined the town by the
revocation of the Edict of Nantes.</p>

<p>The large number of mosaics and inscriptions found in Die prove
conclusively that in Roman times it was a favourite place of residence;
and, so far as situation goes, it is not difficult to understand how this
should have been the case. But in the condition in which the town found
itself in the pitiless heat of August 1864, the only question for an
English visitor was whether he could live through the time it was
absolutely necessary to spend there. The poste arrived, as has been said,
an hour and a half after its time; and the sole occupant of the
coup&eacute;, who had lived on fruit and gooseberry syrup, and three penny
worth of sweet cake at Crest, since a seven-o'clock breakfast, had wiled
away the last hour by inventing choice bills of fare for the meditated
supper. When the lumbering vehicle stopped in the main street of Die,
which is here something under seven yards wide, an elderly woman stepped
out from the dim crowd, with an uncovered tallow candle in her hand, and
asked if there was anyone for the hotel. The unwonted 'yes' seemed to
create some surprise; but she led the way promptly to her hotel,
diplomatically meeting the rapid volley of questions respecting supper
with an unpromising silence, and the first sight of the house itself
dispelled for ever all hope. An entrance was effected by the kitchen; and
not only was there no fire, but there was no light of any <a name=
"Page_219"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;219]</span></a> description;
and the one dip we brought on to the scene betrayed such squalor on all
sides, that the suggestion of a <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i> in connection
with such a kitchen became at once an impudent mockery. When this farther
room was reached, it proved to be even worse than the kitchen. It was shut
up for the night--had been shut up apparently for a week--and was in the
possession of the cats of the town, and the flies of Egypt. Two monstrous
hounds entered with us; and the cats fled hastily by a window which was
slightly open at the top, spitting and howling with fear when they missed
the first spring, and came within the cognisance of their mortal foes.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to wash off some of the accumulated
dust; but when I asked for a bedroom for that purpose, I was conducted to
a copper in the kitchen, the water in which had been a permanency for some
time past, and was told to wash there. As for supper, there was some cold
mutton; but the landlady unfortunately opened the door of the cupboard as
she said so, and displayed a state of things which decided the point
against the mutton. There was nothing else in the house, and there was no
fire for cooking anything; but when they discovered that I really would
not wait till the next morning, they proposed to light a fire and warm
some soup, which I declined to see in its present state. In the way of
wine, I had been recommended to make a great point of the <i>clairette de
Die</i>, an excellent species of <i>vin mousseux</i>; but the chief of the
women rather recommended the ordinary wine of the country, as the monsieur
might not like to give a strong price. 'Was it, then, so strong?' 'Yes,
the price was undoubtedly strong.' 'How much, then?' 'A franc a bottle.'
With an eye to the future bill, the monsieur pretended to ponder awhile,
as if in doubt whether his resources could stand such a strain, and then,
with a reckless air, decided upon the extravagance. <a name="Page_220">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;220]</span></a> The clairette proved to
be quite worthy of the praise which had been bestowed upon it, being a
very pleasant and harmless sparkling white wine.<a name=
"FNanchor93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p>The neighbours kept dropping into the kitchen, to see how the landlady
got on with the stranger of uncouth speech; and four of the female part of
her company brought in at various times to the <i>
salle-&agrave;-manger</i> some piece of table-furniture, in order to
indulge in a closer view than the open door of the room afforded. One of
them told me she had seen an Englishman once before, a few months back;
but he only had one eye, and she seemed to think I was out of order in
possessing two. At length the soup came, and the first attempt upon it
proved it to be utterly impossible. The landlady was called in, and this
fact was announced to her. 'What to do, then?--it was a good soup, a soup
which the people of Die loved,--it was a soup the household eat morning
and night.' All the same, it was not a soup the present Englishman could
eat, and some other sort of food must be provided, for she declined to
furnish soup without garlic and fat. She suggested an omelette; but a
natural generalisation from all I had so far seen drew an untempting
picture of the probable state of the frying-pan, and I declined to face
the idea until I was convinced there was nothing else to be had. But,
alas! notwithstanding the righteous indignation with which the landlady
met my request that the omelette might not be all fat, the manipulation of
the eggs eventuated in a dish even more impracticable than the soup,
flooded with unmentionable grease, and so at last the cold mutton became a
necessity. To show how hunger may work upon the feelings, I may say that,
in spite of the marks of the feet of mice in the cold gravy which remained
on the dish, I forced myself to cut off a wedge, and, after removing a <a
name="Page_221"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;221]</span></a> thick
layer of meat on the exposed sides, essayed to eat the heart of the wedge.
The sheep and its progenitors had been fed on garlic from all time, and
the mutton had been boiled in a decoction of that noxious herb; and this
dish was in its turn rejected like the others. There was nothing for it
but salad, and bread, and wine; but when the salad appeared, after a long
time had been spent in the kitchen in saturating the withered greens with
oil and vitriolic vinegar, there, perched on the top like one of those
animals which sometimes spoil one's enjoyment of a strawberry-bed, was a
huge onion, with numerous satellites peeping out from under the leaves.
About this time, a short diversion was caused by the reappearance of one
of the large hounds, whose mind was not at ease as to the completeness of
the previous elimination of the cats from the <i>
salle-&agrave;-manger;</i> and the diabolical noise and scuffle which
ensued upon his investigation of a dark corner, showed that his doubts had
been well grounded. Then I discovered that there was no butter to be had,
and no milk; and when coffee was mentioned, a pan was brought out for
making that beverage, which a bullet-maker with any regard for appearances
would have declined to use for melting his lead in. Finally, under the
pressure of dire hunger, I returned to the mutton, and contrived to
swallow a small piece, the taste of which did not leave me for four or
five days.</p>

<p>The interior of the house, where the bedrooms were, gave forth an odour
which must be familiar to all who have burrowed in out-of-the-way places
in France, approaching more nearly, perhaps, to the smell of damp cocks
and hens than anything else; and the bedroom door was guarded by a huge
mis-shapen dog, which evidently intended to pass the night there, if it
could not get into the room itself. The street on to which the window
looked was still populous with the inhabitants of Die; and a man with <a
name="Page_222"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;222]</span></a> whom I
had already had a conversation respecting the glaci&egrave;re, who
appeared to perform some of the functions of landlord of the hotel, was
audibly engaged in hiring a man to accompany me on the following day. The
man whom he was attempting to persuade was evidently of an independent
turn of mind, and said that as it would be an affair of fifteen or sixteen
hours at least, he would not go through so much unless his proposed
comrade were a true <i>bonhomme</i>; a difficulty which the landlord set
at rest by asseverations so ready and so circumstantial, that I determined
to take everything he might tell me, on any subject, with many grains of
allowance.</p>

<p>It was only natural to expect a night of horrors; but in this I was
most agreeably disappointed, and the few hours passed quietly enough till
it was time to get up. By morning light, the <i>salle-&agrave;-manger</i>
did so bristle with squalor that the kitchen was made the breakfast-room;
though as that meal only lasted two minutes, and meant nothing beyond an
attempt to eat some of the bread I had been unable to eat the night
before, one place was much the same as another. It is generally believed
that coffee is to be obtained in perfection in France; but that belief is
not founded on experience of the provinces, and had long ceased to be a
part of my creed: nevertheless, with the idea that there is always some
redeeming-point in the darkest situation, I had hopes of the coffee of
Die, in spite of the appearance of the pan; and if these hopes had been
realised, the place might still have been tolerable. But they were not
realised. When the landlady was asked for the promised coffee, she brought
out a small earthenware pitcher containing a black liquid, and proceeded
to bury its lower extremity in the hot embers of the wood fire, by which
means the liquid was speedily warmed up, and also thickened with
unnecessary ashes. When served--in the same dusty <a name="Page_223"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;223]</span></a> pitcher--it had a green and
mouldy taste, combined with a sour bitterness which made it utterly
impossible as an article of food, and so the breakfast was confined to the
rejected fragments of the loaf of the preceding night.</p>

<p>The guide, or comrade as he preferred to call himself, appeared in good
time, and we started about half-past six, under a sun already oppressively
hot, and through heavy flaky dust, which made us feel very thankful when
our route branched off from the high road. Liotir was strong in mulberry
trees and vines, for he was a keeper of silkworms, and a wine-merchant.
Silkworms had not been profitable for a year or two, and he was almost in
low spirits when he talked of them.<a name="FNanchor94"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> An epidemic had visited the district,
and the worms ate voraciously and refused to spin--a disease which he
believed to be beyond the power of medicine.<a name="FNanchor95"></a><a
href="#Footnote_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a> As is so often the case with the
Frenchman, as compared with the Englishman of corresponding social status,
he had his information cut and dried, and poured it out without
hesitation. Silkworms' eggs cost 15, 20, or 25 francs an ounce, according
to quality; and an ounce of good seed should produce from two to three
hundred francs' worth of cocoons. A man who 'makes' an ounce of seed
requires six tables, 8 feet by 4, for his cages; and as some men make
thirty-five ounces, chambers of great size are necessary for the
accommodation of their worms; but breeders to so large an extent as this
are the princes of the trade. As we passed a farmhouse surrounded by <a
name="Page_224"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;224]</span></a> mulberry
trees and vineyards, my companion informed me that the farmer was his
partner in worms and wine both, and that the wine promised to be the
better speculation this year, for the fruit was in immense abundance. I
saw afterwards that, at the time of vintage, grapes sold for pressing at
from 6 to 10 francs the hundred kilos, while 12 and 13 francs was the
price in 1863, and that in some districts of the Dr&ocirc;me the owners of
the presses had not barrels enough for even the first pressing.</p>

<p>The great want of wood on the hills in whose neighbourhood we now found
ourselves, attracted attention in the time of Louis XIV., and that
sovereign passed severe laws for the protection of the forests that still
remained. As usual, the mere severity of the laws made them fail of their
object. Banishment and the galleys were the punishment for unauthorised
cutting of forest trees, and death if fire were used. There is a paper in
the <i>Journal de Physique</i> of 1789,<a name="FNanchor96"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> on the disappearance of the forests of
Dauphin&eacute;, pointing out that when the woods are removed from the
sides of mountains, the soil soon follows, and the district becomes
utterly valueless. The writer traced the mischief to the emancipation of
serfs, and the consequent formation of <i>communes</i>, where each man
could do that which was right in his own eyes.</p>

<p>At any rate, whatever the reason, nothing can be conceived more bare
than the dun-coloured rounded hills between the town of Die and the Col de
Vassieux, towards which we were making our way. The whole face of the
country had the same parched look, and the soil seemed to be composed
entirely of small stones, without any signs of moisture even in the
watercourses. The Col de Vassieux is not much more than 4,000 feet high,
and forms a saddle between the Pic de S. Genix (5,450 feet) and the But <a
name="Page_225"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;225]</span></a> de
l'Aiglette (5,200 feet). A new foot-road has been made to the Col, with
many windings; and great care has been taken to plant the sides of the
hill with oak and hazel; so that already there is some appearance of
coppice, and in the course of time there will be shade by the way--a
luxury for which we longed in vain. The lower ground was covered with
little scrubs of box, and with lavender, dwarfed and dry; but near the
summit of the Col the lavender became vigorous and luxuriant, and carpeted
the hillside with a rich abundance of blue, tempting us more than once to
lie down and roll on the fragrant bed; though some of the older roots were
not sufficiently yielding to make that performance as satisfactory as it
might have been. This lavender is highly prized by the silkworm-keepers of
Die, its bushy heads being almost exclusively used for the worms to spin
their cocoons in.</p>

<p>When we reached the top of the Col, Liotir confessed that he did not
know which way to turn, and we agreed to follow the path till we should
find some one to direct us. There was a farmhouse at no great distance,
and thither we bent our steps; but the sole inhabitant could give no
assistance, and, in default of information, Liotir generously proposed to
treat me to a bottle of wine, over which we might discuss our further
proceedings. The state of fever, however, to which the garlic and the dirt
of Die had brought me, made it seem impossible to eat or drink anything;
so I suggested instead that I should treat him, and that seemed to be
rather what he had meant by his proposal. Nothing much came of our
discussion, and we marched on hot and faint for an hour more, when a
casual man told us that our straight line to the <i>Foire de Fondeurle</i>
lay across the plain on our left hand, and up a most objectionable-looking
hill beyond, thickly covered with brushwood and showing no signs of a
path.</p>

<a name="Page_226"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;226]</span></a>

<p>As we crossed the plain, there was still the same total absence of
water, and we reached the bottom of the hill in a state of mind and body
which rebelled against the exertion of struggling with the sand and
shingle and brushwood. Liotir thought it was useless to attempt it with no
hope of water, and I held much the same view, only it was impossible
really to think of giving it up. When at last we had surmounted all the
difficulties which beset us, and stood on the highest point which had so
far been in sight, we found ourselves on the edge of a vast plain of
parched grass, with nothing to guide us in one direction rather than
another. There was no human being in sight, no sign of water, nor any
particle of shade; nothing but grass, brown and monotonous, with white
cliffs miles away at the extremity of the plain. This was evidently the
<i>Foire de Fondeurle</i>, and in it somewhere lay the glaci&egrave;re, if
only we could make out in which direction to begin to traverse the plain.
In the earlier part of this century, a very famous fair was held on this
wild and out-of-the-way table-land, to which many thousands of horses and
mules and cattle of various kinds were brought from all quarters; but the
fair has fallen off so much, that the man who had turned us up the last
hill said there were only fourteen head of cattle in 1863, and very few of
those were sold. M. H&eacute;ricart de Thury describes this plain as lying
in the calcareous sub-Alpine range of the south-east of France. The woods
here terminate at a height of 5,147 feet above the sea, and the <i>Foire
de Fondeurle</i> lies immediately above this point.</p>

<p>At last we made a bold dash across the plain, and after a time came
upon some sheep, standing in a thick row, with their heads thrust under a
low bank which afforded a little shade; and at no great distance from them
sat the shepherd. He was a cripple, and his clothes were something worse
<a name="Page_227"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;227]</span></a> than
rags. He offered us a portion of the water he had in a detestable-looking
skin; but he assured us it was quite warm, and had not been good to begin
with, so we did not try it, though we were thirsty enough to have hailed a
muddy pool with delight. Our new acquaintance knew nothing of the
glaci&egrave;re, but he belonged himself to the Chal&ecirc;t of Fondeurle,
and as that was the only house on the whole plain, he told us to make for
it. The surface of the plain seemed to have fallen through in many places,
forming larger and smaller pits with steep sides of limestone. These were
often of the size of a large field, and, as the deeper of them required
circumvention, the shepherd told us that we must follow the line of little
cairns which we should find here and there on our way, the only guide
across the plain. He could not be sure himself in what direction the
ch&acirc;let lay; but if we kept to a certain tortuous line, we should
come to it in time.</p>

<p>The way proved to be so very long, that we doubted whether such a
consummation of our wishes would ever arrive: but at length, in a small
dip at the farthest extremity of the plain, we saw the ch&acirc;let, and,
what was much more to us, saw a little run of water, carried from the
rising ground by wooden pipes. It will be well for any future visitor to
the ch&acirc;let to go very warily, and to intrench himself in a strong
position when he sees half-a-dozen huge dogs like black and white bears
come out to attack him. Liotir had a stout stick, and I had a formidable
ice-axe; and, moreover, we fortunately secured a wall in our rear: but
with all this the dogs were nearly too much for us, and Liotir was
pressing me earnestly to chop at the ringleader's head, when a man came
and called off 'Dragon,' and the others then dispersed. The new-comer
wished to know our business, but, without satisfying his curiosity, we
rushed to the water-trough, and drank and used in washing an amount of
water which <a name="Page_228"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;228]</span></a> he evidently grudged us. Then we were able to
tell him that our business was something to eat for Liotir, and a guide to
the glaci&egrave;re; though I trembled when I suggested the latter, for,
after all our labours, I had a sort of fear that the cave would prove a
myth. On this point the man cleared away all doubts at once,--we could
certainly have a guide, as the <i>patron</i> would be sure to let one of
them go with us. As to food, there was more doubt, for the master was not
yet at home, and his wife would not be able to give us an answer without
consulting him. The wife confirmed this statement: they saw very few
strangers, and did not profess to supply food to people crossing the
plain. I assured her that we intended to pay well for anything she could
let us have, but she merely rejoined that they did not keep an auberge;
however, her husband would be home some time in the course of the
afternoon--it was now about half-past twelve--and she could ask his
opinion on the subject. But Liotir objected that he was meanwhile dying of
hunger, and the monsieur of thirst which only milk or cream could assuage;
he suggested that some one should be sent to look for the husband, and
obtain his permission for us to be fed. To this she assented, very
dubiously, and with a constrained air, as if there were some mysterious
reason why the presence of strangers was peculiarly unacceptable on that
particular afternoon. At any rate, she said when pressed, she thought
there could be no harm in our entering the ch&acirc;let and sitting down
on a bench, where we should be sheltered from the sun.</p>

<p>Here accordingly we sat, more or less patiently, till the master
himself appeared. He had no welcome for us; but he was willing that we
should eat some of his black bread, and try his wine. Liotir begged for
cheese, and the wife was told she might supply cheese of two kinds, and
also cream, for the monsieur evidently was <i>malade</i> and could not
swallow <a name="Page_229"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;229]</span></a> wine. The cream and the black bread were
delicious; but still the horrors of Die hung about me, and I could only
dispose of such a small amount, that Liotir waxed funny, and told me it
would never do for me to die there, as there was not earth enough to
scrape a grave in on the whole plain. Then, being a practical man, he
declared he should like to contract for my keep, and thought he could
afford to do it at very small cost to me, and still leave a fair margin
for himself. He thought it right to make up for my want of appetite; and
so, in addition to his own share, he took in an exemplary manner the share
of wine which I should have taken, had I been a man like himself. The
master of the ch&acirc;let sat on the family bed, smoking silently and
sullenly; and as soon as Liotir had come to an end of his second bottle,
he proposed to accompany us himself to the cave, as he doubted whether any
of his men knew the way, and he was sure they were all busy. When I came
to pay his wife for what we had consumed, I administered thanks as well as
money; to which she sternly rejoined, 'Who pays need not give thanks;' and
to that surly view she held, in spite of my attempts to soften her down.
There was, after all, much force in what she said, under the
circumstances. They had given us no welcome, nothing but mere food, and
all they expected in return was a due amount of money; thanks were a
mockery in their eyes.</p>

<p>The cavern was reached in a few minutes, when once we got away from the
ch&acirc;let. Two large pits, formed apparently by the subsidence of the
surface, lay in a line about east and west, and there proved to be an
underground communication between them. From this tunnel, as it were, a
long low archway led to a broad slope of chaotic blocks of stone, down
which we scrambled by the aid of such light as our candles afforded. The
roof of this inner cave was horizontal for some distance, and then <a
name="Page_230"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;230]</span></a> suddenly
descended in a grand wall; and in consequence of a series of such inverted
steps, the cave never assumed any great height. The whole length of the
slope was 190 feet, and its greatest breadth about 140 feet; but the
breadth varied very much. Half-way down the slope the ice commenced,
fitfully at first, and afterwards in a tolerably continuous sheet. The
most careless explorer could not have failed to notice the polygonal
figures stamped upon its surface. They were larger and bolder than any I
had seen before; and the prismatic nuts into which the ice broke, when cut
with the axe, were of course in proportion larger than in the previous
caves. The signs of thaw, too, were unmistakeable. Though the upper
surface of the earth had seemed to be utterly devoid of moisture of any
kind, large drops fell freely from the roof of the cave,<a name=
"FNanchor97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> and the ice
itself was wet. The <i>patron</i> said there was no ice whatever in the
winter months, and that from June to September was the time at which alone
it could be found. He declined to explain how it was that we found it so
evidently in a state of general thaw in the very height of its season. To
give us some idea of the climate of the plain in winter, he informed us
that the snow lay for long up to the top of the door of his
ch&acirc;let.</p>

<p>There were in all four columns of ice in the cave, only two of which
were of any considerable size. One of these was peculiarly striking from
the very large grain which its structure displayed; it measured 19 feet
across the base, being flat towards the extremity of the cave, and round
<a name="Page_231"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;231]</span></a>
towards the entrance. Three thermometers in various parts of the
glaci&egrave;re gave all the same temperature, namely, a fraction under
33&deg; F.: a rough French thermometer gave 1/2&deg; C. The extreme wall
of the cavern was completely covered by a layer of stalagmitic material,
and some of the forms the substance assumed were sufficiently striking. In
contact with the wall, though standing clear of it in parts where the wall
fell inwards, stood a thick round column of the same material, shaped like
the ordinary ice-columns of the glaci&egrave;res, with a cavity near the
base, and in all ways following the usual laws of such columns.
Considering that I had observed a layer of limestone-paste collecting on
one of the ice-columns of the Glaci&egrave;re of La Genolli&egrave;re, I
could not help imagining that this stalagmitic column had been originally
moulded on a norm of that description. It had a girth of 12 feet in the
part where we were able to pass the tape round it. Its surface was smooth;
but when we drove a hole through this, with much damage to the <i>pic</i>
of my axe, we found that the interior was in a crystalline form.</p>

<p>There was, on the whole, very little to be seen in the glaci&egrave;re.
Had it been my first experience of an ice-cave, it would doubtless have
seemed very remarkable, as it did to Liotir, who, by the way, had steadily
disbelieved the possibility of natural ice in summer except in the
glaciers; but as I had now seen so many, several of them much more
wonderful than this, I did not care to stay longer than was absolutely
necessary for measurements and investigation. Besides, the food of
Dauphin&eacute; rather takes the energy and love of adventure out of an
unaccustomed visitor.</p>

<p>Without long delay, then, we bade farewell to the <i>patron</i>, not
returning to the inhospitable ch&acirc;let, and started on our way for
Die, <a name="Page_232"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;232]</span></a>
each carrying a large block of ice slung in a network of string. Liotir's
purpose was to convince some mysterious female friend that he really had
seen ice in summer, within five or six hours of Die; and mine, to apply
the ice to the butter which I had specially ordered the landlady to have
ready for me, that so I might be able to get through the night, and leave
Die by the diligence the first thing next morning. It was remarkable how
well the ice bore the great heat. For long the bulk of the masses we
carried seemed scarcely to diminish; and if it had not been for a course
of heavy falls as we descended through the brushwood, we should have
succeeded in getting a large proportion of it safely to Die. The precision
of the prismatic structure also showed itself in a very marked manner; and
when we came to a crisis of thirst, which happened at shorter and shorter
intervals as the afternoon wore on, we separated the prisms with our
fingers from the edges of the ice without any difficulty, and made
ourselves more hot and thirsty by eating them.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the farmhouse at the Col de Vassieux, we reaped full
benefit from our ice. The wine, which had been hot and heavy and
unpalatable in the morning, when we had tried it unmixed, became
delightfully refreshing when disguised with an abundance of water and
sugar and ice; and Liotir found that contracting for my keep at a low rate
would not, after all, secure him the comfortable income he had before
calculated. After this refreshment, he became communicative, and told me
he had served seven years in the French army, three of which were spent in
working on railways. He had fought the Italian campaign, and was full of
details of the battle of Solferino, on which occasion his <i>bataillon</i>
was led on by the Emperor in person. According to his account, four <i>
bataillons</i> were drawn up for the assault of a tower, and <a name=
"Page_233"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;233]</span></a> when the first
advanced it was swept away to a man. The second met with a like fate, and
Liotir was in the third. His officers had all been killed, and a corporal
was in command. The Emperor rode up and called to them to advance as far
as he advanced. This was about a hundred yards; and then, after halting
them for a moment, the Emperor cried, '<i>Allez, mes enfants! nous ne
sommes pas tous perdus!'</i> sending the fourth <i>bataillon</i> close
upon their heels. In answer to my question, Liotir said, slowly and
solemnly, that he did not think the Emperor was under fire; a few dropping
shots reached them while he was yet addressing them, but he believed the
Emperor Napoleon was not in the fire at Solferino. I took the opportunity
of asking whether he was green on that occasion, as Mr. Kinglake believes
that he is in times of personal danger; but my companion utterly scouted
the idea, and declared that he saw no man through all that day so cool and
capable as the Emperor. Pale he undoubtedly was, but that was his habit.
Like all other French soldiers with whom I have had much conversation,
Liotir complained of the army arrangements in the matter of food; on all
other points he was most amiable, but when he spoke of the extortions of
the <i>cantini&egrave;re</i> he completely lost his temper. At a <i>
caf&eacute;</i>, the soldiers could get their cup for 15 centimes, or 20
with liqueur; whereas the <i>cantini&egrave;re</i> charged a franc, and
gave them very bad coffee. Wine, too, which would cost them 60 centimes
the kilo in the town, was valued at 2 francs by their grasping enemy. He
had an idea that English soldiers are allowed to take their whole pay in
money, and spend it as they will; whereas the French foot-soldier,
according to his account, gets 25 centimes a day in money, and has
everything found except coffee. A young trooper at Besan&ccedil;on was
very eloquent on this subject. He represented himself as a <a name=
"Page_234"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;234]</span></a> man of small
appetite and a gay spirit; he could well live on very little solid food,
and yet he had as much deducted from his pay on that account as anyone in
the army--as much, for instance, he groaned, as a certain stout old
warrior who was then reposing on a corn-bin. If he could have drawn all
his pay in money, and lived on almost nothing for food, he would have had
abundance of sous for cards and tobacco; and what a career would that
be!</p>

<p>The blocks of ice were by this time becoming rather small; and as we
had now once more reached the region of lavender, we cut a large quantity
and wrapped the ice in it, and thus protected it from further thaw. For
some time before arriving at the farm where my companion's partner lived,
he indulged in praises of the wine which their vineyard produced, and
assurances of the safety with which it would perform a journey to England.
He urged its excellent <i>bouquet</i>, and gave me a card of prices which
certainly seemed marvellously reasonable. Finally, he proposed to join me
at a bottle of white <i>muscat</i>, from the farmer's <i>cave</i>, in
order that I might have an opportunity of seeing how true was his account
of the wine. We seated ourselves accordingly in the farmyard, and drank a
bottle of delightful wine at 65 centimes the bottle, clear and sparkling,
and with a strong muscat flavour. Liotir combined with it intoxication of
a different kind, and showed unmistakeable signs of his determination to
take another member of the farmer's household into partnership,--the
mysterious friend, in fact, for whose astonishment the ice was intended.
The white muscat, they told me, would not keep over the year; but they had
a wine at the same price which they highly recommended, and warranted to
keep for a considerable number of years. Liotir was very anxious that we
should have a bottle of this, for he was <a name="Page_235"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;235]</span></a> confident that I should give them an
order if I once tasted it; but we had been in at the death of so many
bottles that day, that I declined to try the <i>muscat rosat</i>. I have
since had a hundred <i>litres</i> sent over by Liotir, and find it very
satisfactory. It has a rich, clear, port-wine colour, sparkling, and with
the true <i>frontignac</i> flavour.</p>

<p>The effect of the wine on Liotir was peculiar. In the earlier part of
the walk, he had never seen Algeria; but after half a bottle of muscat, he
had spent six months in that country, and he enlivened the remainder of
the way with many details of his experiences there. We reached Die about
half-past seven, and the arrival of real ice was hailed as a marvel.
Although I had been sent off so unhesitatingly by the landlord in the
morning, it seemed that they none of them knew what a glaci&egrave;re
meant. They had determined that we should never reach the <i>Foire de
Fondeurle</i>, and that if we did, we should find nothing there to repay
our toil. As I sat at an open window afterwards, Liotir's voice was to be
heard holding forth in a neighbouring caf&eacute; upon the wonders of the
day; and among the crowd which is a normal condition of the evening
streets of Die, the words <i>Fondeurle</i>, <i>Vassieux</i>, <i>
Anglais</i>, <i>glace</i>, &amp;c., showed what the general subject of
conversation was.</p>

<p>The landlady had obeyed orders, and was provided with butter and bread.
The tea was served in an open earthenware pitcher, with the spout at right
angles with the handle. There was no cup; but the woman remarked that if
monsieur was particular about that, he could turn out the sugar and use
the basin, which he did. The milk had a basin to itself; but it had
offered so large and tempting a surface to the flies of the town, that it
remained untouched. The knife and spoon were imbued with ineradicable
garlic, and my own trusty clasp-knife was the only weapon I <a name=
"Page_236"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;236]</span></a> could use for
all table purposes. If it had not been for the ice and the lavender, I
think I should never have got away from Die. The former made it possible
to eat some bread-and-butter; and of the latter I made a sort of
respirator for nose and mouth, which modified the odour of cocks and hens
prevailing in the house.</p>

<p>Next morning the diligence was to start early, and, in preparation for
the six hours' drive, I ordered two eggs to be boiled for breakfast. As
the first proved to have been boiled in tepid water, I requested the
landlady to boil the second afresh, which she did in a manner that may
partly account for the observed fact that the very eggs of some towns
taste of garlic. There was household soup simmering on the fire, reeking
with onion and garlic, and many other abominations; and, as if it was
quite the right and usual thing to do, she slipped the unfortunate egg
into this, and left it there to be cooked. After all, garlic must be cheap
as an article of food, for the whole bill amounted only to 7-1/2
francs.</p>

<p>This was the last glaci&egrave;re on my list. It was quite as well that
such was the case; for the trials of Dauphin&eacute; had been too great,
and I should scarcely have been inclined to face further adventures of a
like kind.</p>

<h3>OTHER ICE CAVES.</h3>

<b><i>The Cave of Szelicze, or Szilitze, in Hungary</i>.<a name=
"FNanchor98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a></b> <br />


<p>Matthew Bell, the historian of Hungary, sent an account of this cavern
to England, in the middle of the last century, which was printed in the
original Latin in the 'Philosophical Transactions' of 1739-40 (pp. 41,
&amp;c.).</p>

<p>This account states that the cave is in the county of Thorn,<a name=
"FNanchor99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> among the
lowest spurs of the Carpathians. The entrance, which faces the north, and
is exposed to the cold winds from the snowy part of the Carpathian range,
is 18 fathoms high and 9 broad; and the cave spreads out laterally, and
descends to a point 50 fathoms below the entrance, where it is 26 fathoms
in breadth, and of irregular height. Beyond this no one had at that time
penetrated, on account of the unsafe footing, although many distant echoes
were returned by the farther recesses of <a name="Page_238"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;238]</span></a> the cave; indeed, to get even so far
as this, much step-cutting was necessary.</p>

<p>When the external frost of winter comes on, the account proceeds, the
effect in the cave is the same as if fires had been lighted there: the ice
melts, and swarms of flies and bats and hares take refuge in the interior
from the severity of the winter. As soon as spring arrives, the warmth of
winter disappears from the interior, water exudes from the roof and is
converted into ice, while the more abundant supplies which pour down on to
the sandy floor are speedily frozen there. In the Dog-days, the frost is
so intense that a small icicle becomes in one day a huge mass of ice; but
a cool day promptly brings a thaw, and the cave is looked upon as a
barometer, not merely feeling, but also presaging, the changes of weather.
The people of the neighbourhood, when employed in field-work, arrange
their labour so that the mid-day meal may be taken near the cave, when
they either ice the water they have brought with them, or drink the melted
ice, which they consider very good for the stomach. It had been calculated
that 600 weekly carts would not be sufficient to keep the cavern free from
ice. The ground above the cave is peculiarly rich in grass.</p>

<p>In explanation of these phenomena, Bell threw out the following
suggestions, which need no comment. The earth being of itself cold and
damp, the external heat of the atmosphere, by partially penetrating into
the ground, drives in this native cold to the inner parts of the earth,
and makes the cold there more dense. On the other hand, when the external
air is cold, it draws forth towards the surface the heat there may be in
the inner part of the earth, and thus makes caverns warm. In support and
illustration of this view, he states that in the hotter parts of Hungary,
when the people wish to cool their wine, they dig a <a name="Page_239">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;239]</span></a> hole 2 feet deep, and
place in it the flagon of wine, and, after filling up the hole again,
light a blazing fire upon the surface, which cools the wine as if the
flagon had been laid in ice. He also suggests that possibly the cold winds
from the Carpathians bring with them imperceptible particles of snow,
which reach the water of the cave, and convert it into ice. Further, the
rocks of the Carpathians abound in salts, nitre, alum, &amp;c., which may,
perhaps, mingle with such snowy particles, and produce the ordinary effect
of the snow and salt in the artificial production of ice.</p>

<p>Townson<a name="FNanchor100"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> visited this cave half a century
later, and concluded that Bell was in error with regard to the supposed
winter thaw and summer frost, although he himself received information at
Kaschau which corroborated the earlier account. He describes the approach
to the village of Szilitze as leading by a by-road through a pleasant
country of woods and hills, with much pasture-land, the cave lying a mile
beyond the village, and displaying an entrance 100 feet broad, and 20 or
30 feet high, turned towards the north. The descent of the floor of the
cave is rapid, and was covered with thin ice, at the time of his visit,
for the last third of the way: from the roof at the farther end, where the
cave is not so high as at the entrance, a congeries of icicles was seen to
hang; and in a corner on the right, completely sheltered from the rays of
the sun, there was a large mass of the same material. It was a fine
forenoon in July, and all was in a state of thaw, the icicles dropping
water, and the floor of ice covered with a thin layer of water; while the
thermometer in all parts of the cave stood at zero of R&eacute;aumur's
scale. The rock is compact unstratified limestone, in which so many of the
famous caverns of the world are found.</p>

<a name="Page_240"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;240]</span></a> <b><i>
The Cave of Yeermalik, in Koondooz</i></b><a name="FNanchor101"></a><a
href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>

<p>In the year 1840, Captain Burslem, of the 13th Light Infantry, made an
expedition from Cabul to the North-west, accompanied by Lieutenant Sturt
of the Bengal Engineers, who was afterwards killed in the terrible pass
where Lady Sale, whose daughter he had married, was shot through the
arm.</p>

<p>After crossing the high and wild pass of Karakotul (10,500 feet), these
travellers reached the romantic glen of the Doaub, which lies at the foot
of the pass, and is surrounded on all sides by lofty mountains. Here they
were hospitably entertained by Shah Pursund Khan, the chief of the small
territory, and their curiosity was roused by the account given by an old
moollah of a cavern seven miles off, which the Shah strongly advised them
not to attempt to visit, for the Sheitan (the devil), whose ordinary place
of abode it was, never allowed a stranger to return from its recesses. The
moollah, however, scouted this idea, on the ground that it was much too
cold for such an inhabitant; and the Shah eventually agreed to accompany
them to the cave with a band of his followers.</p>

<p>As they rode through long and rich grass, following the course of a
gentle stream, and tormented by swarms of forest flies, or blood-suckers,
the Shah informed them that he had once endeavoured to explore the cave,
and had already penetrated to a considerable distance, when he came upon
the fresh prints of a naked foot, with an extraordinary impression by
their side, which he suspected to be the foot of Sheitan himself, and so
he beat a precipitate retreat.<a name="Page_241"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;241]</span></a> The moollah told them that there was
a large number of skeletons in the cave, the remains of 700 men who took
refuge there during the invasion of Genghis Khan, with their wives and
families, and defended themselves so stoutly, that, after trying in vain
the means by which the M'Leods were destroyed in barbarous times, and the
opponents of French progress in Algeria in times less remote, the invader
built them in with huge natural blocks of stone, and left them to die of
hunger.</p>

<p>The entrance is half-way up a hill, and is 50 feet high, with about the
same breadth. Not far from the entrance they found a passage between two
jagged rocks, possibly the remains of Genghis Khan's fatal wall, so narrow
that they had some difficulty in squeezing through; and then, before long,
came to a drop of 16 feet, down which they were lowered by ropes made from
the cotton turbans of the Shah and his attendants. Here they left two men
to haul them up on their return, and bade farewell to the light of day.
The narrow path led by the edge of a black abyss, sometimes over a
flooring of smooth ice for a few feet, and widened gradually till they
reached a damp and dripping hall, of dimensions so vast that the light of
their torches did not enable them to form a conception of its size. In
this hall they found hundreds of skeletons in a perfectly undisturbed
state, one, for instance, still holding the skeletons of two infants in
its bony arms, while some of the bodies had been preserved, and lay
shrivelled like those at the Great St. Bernard. They were very much
startled here by the discovery of the prints of a naked human foot, and by
its side the distinct mark of the pointed heel of an Affghan boot,<a name=
"FNanchor102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> precisely
what had so thoroughly frightened the <a name="Page_242"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;242]</span></a> Shah twelve years before. The prints
retained all the sharpness of outline which marks a recent impression, and
led towards the farther recesses of the cave; but the Englishmen were
called away from their investigation by the announcement that if they did
not make haste, there would not be oil enough for lighting them to the
ice-caves.</p>

<p>Proceeding through several low arches and smaller caves, they reached
at length a vast hall, in the centre of which was<a name=
"FNanchor103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> an enormous
mass of clear ice, smooth and polished as a mirror, and in the form of a
gigantic beehive, with its dome-shaped top just touching the long icicles
which depended from the jagged surface of the rock. A small aperture led
to the interior of this wonderful congelation, the walls of which were
nearly 2 feet thick; the floor, sides, and roof were smooth and slippery,
and their figures were reflected from floor to ceiling and from side to
side in endless repetition. The inside of this chilly abode was divided
into several compartments of every fantastic shape: in some the glittering
icicles hung like curtains from the roof; in others, the vault was smooth
as glass. Beautifully brilliant were the prismatic colours reflected from
the varied surface of the ice, when the torches flashed suddenly upon them
as they passed from cave to cave. Around, above, beneath, everything was
of solid ice, and being unable to stand on account of its slippery nature,
they slid, or rather glided, mysteriously along the glassy surface of this
hall of spells. In one of the largest compartments the icicles had reached
the floor, and gave the idea of pillars supporting the roof.</p>

<p>The cavern in which this marvellous mass of ice stood, branched off
into numerous galleries, one of which led the party to a sloping platform
of rapidly increasing steepness, where they were startled by the
reappearance of the naked foot-prints, passing down the slope. The toes <a
name="Page_243"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;243]</span></a> were
spread out in a manner which showed that they belonged to some one who had
been in the habit of going barefoot, and Captain Burslem took a torch and
determined to trace the steps: a large stone, however, gave way under his
weight; and this, sliding down at first, and then rolling and bounding on
for ever, raised such a tumult of noise and echoes that the natives with
one accord cried 'Sheitan! Sheitan!' and fled precipitately, extinguishing
all the lights in their fear; so that but for Sturt's torch the whole
party must have been lost in the darkness. Shah Pursund Khan at once
called a retreat, vowing that it was of no use to attempt to follow the
footsteps, as it was well known that the cave extended to Cabul! The
guides had now lost their small allowance of pluck, and wandered about
despairingly for a long time before they could find their way back to the
ice-cave, and thence to the foot of the rock where the two men and the
turban-ladders had been left. As soon as they came in sight of this, their
comrades above cried out to them that they must make all haste, for
Sheitan himself had appeared an hour before, running along the ledge where
they now were, and finally vanishing into the gloom beyond; an
announcement which of course produced a stampede in the terrified party of
natives. Five or six rushed to the spot where the turbans hung, and only
an opportune fall of stones from above prevented their destroying the
apparatus in their blind hurry to escape. The chief claimed the privilege
of being drawn up first, and he and all his followers declared that
nothing should ever tempt them to visit again the Cave of Yeermalik.<a

The Surtshellir, in Iceland</i></b>.

<p>The first account of this lava-cavern is given by Olafsen,<a name=
"FNanchor105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> who visited
it in 1750 and 1753. Ebenezer Henderson<a name="FNanchor106"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> explored it in 1815, and Captain
Forbes gives some account of it in his recent book on Iceland.<a name=
"FNanchor107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> It is
mentioned in some of the Sagas,<a name="FNanchor108"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> and appears to have been a refuge for
robbers in the tenth century, and Sturla Sigvatson, with a large band of
followers, spent some time here. The Landnama Saga derives the name
Surtshellir from a huge giant called Surtur, who made his abode in the
cave; but Olafsen believed that the name merely meant <i>black hole</i>,
from <i>surtur</i> or <i>svartur</i>, and was due to the darkness of the
cave and the colour of the lava: in accordance with this view, it is
called <i>Hellerin Sortur</i>, or <i>black hole</i>, in some of the
earlier writings. The common people are convinced that it is inhabited by
ghosts; and Olafsen and his party were assured that they would be turned
back by horrible noises, or else killed outright by the spirits of the
cave: at any rate, their informants declared they would no more reach the
inner parts of the cavern than they had reached the traditional green
valley of Aradal, isolated in the midst of glaciers, with its wild
population of descendants of the giants, which they had endeavoured to
find some time before.<a name="FNanchor109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<a name="Page_245"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;245]</span></a>

<p>The cave is in the form of a tunnel a mile or more in length, with
innumerable ramifications, in the lava which has flowed from the Bald
Y&ouml;kul. It lies on the edge of the uninhabited waste called the
Arnavatns-heidi, in a district described by Captain Forbes as distorted
and devilish, a cast-iron sea of lava. The approach is through an open
chasm, 20 to 40 feet in depth, and 50 feet broad, leading to the entrance
of the cave, where the height is between 30 and 40 feet, and the breadth
rather more than 50. Henderson found a large quantity of congealed snow at
this entrance, and along pool of water resting on a floor of ice, which
turned his party back and forced them to seek another entrance, where
again they found snow piled up to a considerable height. Olafsen also
mentions collections of snow under the various openings in the lava which
forms the roof of the cave. The latter explorer discovered interesting
signs of the early inhabitants of the Surtshellir, as, for instance, the
common bedstead, built of stones, 2-1/2 feet high, 36 feet long, and 14
feet broad, with a pathway down the middle, forming the only passage to
the inner parts of the cave. The spaces enclosed by these stones were
strewn with black sand, on which rough wool was probably laid by way of
mattress. This could scarcely have been a bedstead in the time of the
giants, for a total breadth of 14 feet, deducting for the pathway down the
middle, will not give more than 6 feet for the layer of men on either
side, unless indeed they lay parallel to the passage, and required a
length of 36 feet. He also found an old wall, built with blocks of lava
across one part of the cave, as if for defence, and a large circular heap
of the bones of sheep and oxen, presumably the remains of many years of
feasting. Captain Forbes scoffs at these bones, and suggests errant wild
ponies as the depositors <a name="Page_246"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;246]</span></a> thereof.</p>

<p>Olafsen had found in his earlier visit that the way was stopped, far in
the recesses of the cave, by a lake of water, which filled the tunnel to a
depth of 3 feet or more, lying on ice; but in 1753 there was not more than
a foot of water, through which they waded without much difficulty. The air
soon became exceedingly cold and thick, and for some hundreds of paces
they saw no light of day, till at length they reached a welcome opening in
the roof. Beyond this, the air grew colder and more thick, and the walls
were found to be sheeted with ice from roof to floor, or covered with
broad and connected icicles. The ground also was a mass of ice, but an
inch or two of fine brown earth lay upon it, which enabled them to keep
their footing. This earth appeared to have been brought down by the water
which filtered through the roof. 'The most wonderful thing,' Olafsen
remarks, 'that we noticed here, was, that the stalactites of ice were set
with regular figures of five and seven sides, joined together, and
resembling those seen on the second stomach of ruminating animals. The
condensed cold of the air must have imparted these figures to the ice;
they were not external (merely?), but in the ice itself, which otherwise
was clear and transparent.'</p>

<p>Henderson and his party appear to have had much more wading to do than
Olafsen, walking in one instance through a long tract of water up to the
knees. In the deeper recesses of the cave, apparently in the part where
the earlier explorers had found the reticulated ice, they found the whole
floor of the passage covered with thick ice, with so steep a dip that they
sat down and slid forward by their own weight--a most undignified
proceeding for a grave gentleman on a mission from the Bible Society. On
holding their torches close to the floor, they saw down to a depth of 7 or
8 feet, the ice being as clear as crystal. 'The roof and sides of the cave
were decorated with most superb icicles, crystallised <a name="Page_247">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;247]</span></a> in every possible form,
many of which rivalled in minuteness the finest zeolites; while from the
icy floor rose pillars of the same substance, assuming all the curious and
phantastic shapes imaginable, mocking the proudest specimens of art, and
counterfeiting many well-known objects of animated nature. Many of them
were upwards of 4 feet high, generally sharpened at the extremity, and
about 2 feet in thickness. A more brilliant scene perhaps never presented
itself to the human eye, nor was it easy for us to divest ourselves of the
idea that we actually beheld one of the fairy scenes depicted in Eastern
fable. The light of the torches rendered it peculiarly enchanting.'</p>

<p>Captain Forbes found much ice on the floor, but he did not enjoy the
cold and wet, and seems to have ascended by the last opening in the roof,
mentioned by Olafsen, before reaching the cavern where the more beautiful
parts of the ice-decoration were found by his predecessors. The two
engravings of the interior of the cave given in his book are copied from
the magnificent lithographs of Paul Gaimard,<a name="FNanchor110"></a><a
href="#Footnote_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> but much of the effect has been
lost in the process of copying.</p>

<p>Mr. Baring Gould mentions this cavern in his book on Iceland, and
believes that its interest has been much overrated. He seems to have
visited the cave, but makes no allusion to the existence of ice.<a name=
"FNanchor111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p>Mr. E.T. Holland visited the Surtshellir in the course of his tour in
Iceland, in 1861, and an account of his visit is given in the first volume
of 'Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers.'<a name="FNanchor112"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> After following in Olafsen's steps
for some time, the party reached a cave whose floor was composed of very
clear ice, apparently of great thickness, for they could not see the lava
beneath it. The walking on this smooth ice-floor <a name="Page_248"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;248]</span></a> Mr. Holland describes as being
delightful, the whole sloping considerably downwards. 'In five minutes,'
he continues, 'we reached the most beautiful fairy grotto imaginable. From
the crystal floor of ice rose up group after group of transparent icy
pillars, while from the glittering roof most brilliant icy pendants hung
down to meet them. Columns and arches of ice were ranged along the
crystalline walls ... I never saw a more brilliant scene; and indeed it
would be difficult to imagine anything more fairy-like. The pillars were
many of them of great size, tapering to a point as they rose. The largest
were at least 8 feet high, and 6 feet in circumference at their base. The
stalactites were on an equally grand scale. Through this lovely ice-grotto
we walked for nearly ten minutes.'</p>

<p>The temperature of the caves, Mr. Holland states in a note, was from

<p><b><i>The Gypsum Cave of Illetzkaya-Zastchita, in the Steppes of the
Kirghis, South of Orenburg</i>.</b></p>

<p>The district in which this cavern occurs is a small green oasis on the
undulating steppe, lying on a vast bed of rock-salt, which extends over an
area of two versts in length, and a mile in breadth, with a thickness of
more than 100 feet. When the thin cover of red sand and marl is removed,
the white salt is exposed, and is found to be so free from all stain, or
admixture of other material, excepting sometimes minute filaments of
gypsum, that it is pounded at once for use, without any cleansing or
recrystallising process.</p>

<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of Illetzkaya-Zastchita there are two or
three gypseous hillocks, and a cavern in one of these is used by the
inhabitants as a cellar, having been artificially enlarged for that
purpose. Sir Roderick Murchison and his colleagues visited this cavern on
a hot day in August, with the thermometer at 90&deg; in the shade, in the
course of their travels under the patronage of the late Emperor of
Russia.<a name="FNanchor113"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> They found the hillock to be an
irregular cone 150 feet in height; the entrance was by a frail door, on a
level with the village street, and fully exposed to the rays of the sun;
and yet, when the door was opened, so piercing a current of cold air
poured forth, that they were glad to beat a retreat for a while; and on
eventually exploring farther, they found the quass and provisions, stored
in the cave, half-frozen within three or four paces of the door. The chasm
soon opened out into a natural vault from 12 to 15 feet high, 10 or 12
paces long, and 7 or 8 in width, which seemed to have numerous small <a
name="Page_250"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;250]</span></a>
ramifications into the impending mound of gypsum and marl. The roof of
this inner cavern was hung with undripping solid icicles, and the floor
was a conglomerate of ice and frozen earth. They were assured that the
cold is always greatest within when the external air is hottest and
driest, and that the ice gradually disappears as winter approaches, and
vanishes when the snow comes. The peasants were unanimous in these
statements, and asserted that they could sleep in the cave without
sheepskins in the depth of winter.</p>

<p>Sir Roderick Murchison and his friends were at first inclined to
explain these phenomena by supposing that the chief fissure communicated
with some surface of rock-salt, 'the saliferous vapours of which might be
so rapidly evaporated or changed in escaping to an intensely hot and dry
atmosphere as to produce ice and snow.' But Sir John Herschel, to whom
they applied for assistance, rejected the evaporation theory, and
suggested that the external summer wave of heat might possibly only reach
the cave at Christmas, being delayed six months in its passage through the
rock; the cold of winter, in the same manner, arriving at midsummer. To
this the explorers objected, that the mound contained many caves, but'
only in this particular fissure was any ice found. Dr. Robinson,
astronomer at Armagh, endeavoured to explain the matter by referring to De
Saussure's explanation of the phenomena of <i>cold caves</i> in Italy and
elsewhere; but this, too, was considered unsatisfactory. At length,
Professor Wheatstone referred them to the memoir by Professor Pictet, in
the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Universelle</i> of Geneva, where that <i>
savant</i> improves upon De Saussure's theory, and applies it in its new
form to the case of caves containing permanent ice, in tracts whose mean
cold is above the freezing point. This they seem to have accepted, adding
that the climatological circumstances of Orenburg--a <a name="Page_251">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;251]</span></a> wet spring, caused by the
melting of the abundant snows, followed by a summer of intense and dry
Asiatic heat--must be particularly favourable for the working out of the
theory, and must also act powerfully in producing the refrigerating
effects of evaporation.<a name="FNanchor114"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a></p>

<p>The traveller Pallas visited Illetzkaya in July 1769, and describes
this gypseous hillock.<a name="FNanchor115"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> In his time the entrance by the side
of the hill was unknown, as also was the existence of ice in the cavern.
He saw at the top of the Kraoul-na&iuml;-Gora, or Watch-mountain, as it
was called, a fissure which had once formed a large cavern, into which the
Kirghis were in the habit of throwing furs and other materials as
religious offerings. Although the cave had since fallen in, they still
kept up a part of the ceremony, marching solemnly round the base of the
hill once a year, and bathing in the neighbouring water. In earlier times,
a man had descended through the fissure by means of cords, and found the
cold within insupportable, having very probably reached the present
ice-cave.</p>

<p>Pallas describes many caves in various parts of Russia, but never seems
to hint at the existence of ice in them, though he specially mentions
their extreme cold. Some of these occurred in gypsum, and some in
limestone; and the gypseous caves showed universally a very low
temperature, though still far above the freezing-point.<a name=
"FNanchor116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>: <a name=
"Page_252"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;252]</span></a> Thus in the
dark cavern of Barnoukova,<a name="FNanchor117"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> on the Piana, in a rock of gypsum,
while the thermometer in the shade stood at 75&deg;&bull;2, the
temperatures at various points in the cave were,--at the entrance
59&deg;&bull;36, 25 feet from the entrance 46&deg;&bull;4, and in the
coldest part 42&deg;&bull;8. This cold he describes as insupportable. The
temperature of the water which had accumulated in the coldest parts of the
cave was 48&deg;&bull;8, considerably higher than the surrounding
atmosphere; from which Pallas concluded that the cold of gypsum-caves is
due to the acid vapours which are generally observed in grottoes of this
description. In May 1770, he found snow on the sloping entrance to the
cavern of Loekl&eacute;, in the neighbourhood of the Oufa; but the air of
the interior was not colder than was to be expected in a deep cave.</p>

<p>Sir R. Murchison wrote to Russia for further information with respect
to this cave in January 1865, and again in the beginning of April,
addressing his second enquiry to the Secretary of the Imperial Academy. In
reply, the Secretary says that he is not aware that any thermometric
observations have been made in the cavern. He encloses a short statement
by M. Helmersen, one of the members of the Academy, to the following
effect:--About 50 versts SE. of Miask, in the chain of the Ural, is a
copper mine, called Kirobinskoy, which was abandoned more than fifty years
ago. On the 7th July, 1826, M. Helmersen found a thick wainscoting of ice
on the sides and roof and floor of the horizontal gallery, within 10 feet
of the entrance. He was assured that this ice never melts, and <a name=
"Page_253"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;253]</span></a> that its
thickness is greater in summer than in winter. M. Helmersen adds, that to
the best of his belief no one has investigated the cavern of Illetzkaya
Zastchita since Sir R. Murchison's visit.</p>

<b><i>The Ice-Cavern of the Peak of Teneriffe</i></b>.<a name=
"FNanchor118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>

<p>This cave is at a height of 11,040 feet above the sea, and is therefore
not far below the snow-line of the latitudes of the Canary Isles. The
entrance is by a hole 3 or 4 feet square, in the roof of the cave, which
may be about 20 feet from the floor. The peasants who convey snow and ice
from the cave to the lower regions, enter by means of knotted ropes; but
Professor Smyth had caused his ship's carpenter to prepare a stout ladder,
by which photographic instruments and a lady were taken down.</p>

<p>On alighting on a heap of stones at the bottom, the party found
themselves surrounded by a sloping wall of snow, 3 feet high, and 7 or 8
feet broad, the basin in which they stood being formed in the snow by the
vertical rays of the sun, and by the dropping of water from the edges of
the hole.<a name="FNanchor119"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> Beyond this ring-fence, large
surfaces of water stretched away into the farther recesses of the cave,
resting on a layer of ice, which appeared to be generally about 2 feet
thick. At one of the deeper ends of the cave, water dropped continually
from the crevices of the roof; a fact which Professor Smyth attributed to
the slow advance of the summer wave of heat through the superincumbent
rock, which was only <a name="Page_254"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;254]</span></a> now reaching the inner recesses of the loose
lava, and liquefying the results of the past winter. There would seem to
be immense infiltration of meteoric water on the Peak; for,
notwithstanding the great depth of rain which falls annually in a liquid
or congealed form, the sides of the mountain are not scored with the lines
of water-torrents.</p>

<p>Though occurring in lava, this cavern is quite different from
lava-tunnels, such as the Surtshellir, which are recognised formations,
produced by the cooling of the terminal surface-crust of the stream of
lava, and the subsequent bursting forth of the molten stream within. This,
on the contrary, proved to be a smooth dome-shaped cave, running off into
three contracting lobes or tunnels which might be respectively 70, 50, and
40 feet long, and were all filled to a certain depth with water: in the
smoothness of the interior surfaces, Professor Smyth believed that he
detected the action of highly elastic gases on a plastic material.</p>

<p>The astronomer takes exception to the term 'underground glacier' <a
name="FNanchor120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> which
had been applied to this cavern. He represents that the mountain is
abundantly covered each winter with snow, in the neighbourhood of the
ice-cave, which is nearly within the snow-line, and the stores of snow
thus accumulated in the cave have no great difficulty in resisting the
effects of summer heat, since all radiation is cut off by the roof of
rocks. The importance of this protection may be understood from the fact
that in the middle of July the thermometer at this altitude gave 130&deg;
in the sun, but fell to 47&deg; when relieved from the heat due to
radiation. At the time of this observation, there were still patches of
snow lying on the mountain-side, exposed to the full power of direct
radiation; and, therefore, there is not anything very surprising in the
permanence <a name="Page_255"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;255]</span></a> of snow under such favourable circumstances as
are developed in the cave. Mr. Airy, a few summers ago, found the rooms of
the Casa Inglese, on Mount Etna, half filled with snow, which had drifted
in by an open door, and had been preserved from solar radiation by the
thick roof.<a name="FNanchor121"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p>Humboldt remarks, that the mean temperature of the region in which the
Cueva del Hielo (ice-cave) occurs, is not below 3&deg; C.
(37&middot;4&deg; F.), but so much snow and ice are stored up in the
winter that the utmost efforts of the summer heat cannot melt it all. He
adds, that the existence of permanent snow in holes or caves must depend
more upon the amount of winter snow, and the freedom from hot winds, than
on the absolute elevation of the locality.</p>

<p>The natives of Teneriffe are men of faith. They have large belief in
the existence and intercommunication of numerous vast caverns in the Peak,
one of which, on the north coast, is said to communicate with the
ice-cavern, notwithstanding 8 miles of horizontal distance, and 11,000
feet of vertical depth. The truth of this particular article of their
creed has been recently tested by several worthy and reverend hidalgos,
who drove a dog into the entrance of the cavern on the sea-coast, in the
belief that he would eventually come to light again in the ice-cave: he
was accordingly found lying there some days after, greatly fatigued and
emaciated, having in the interval accomplished the 11,000 feet of
subterranean climbing. How he could enter, from below, a water-logged
cave, does not appear to have been explained.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>BRIEF NOTICES OF OTHER ICE-CAVES.</h3>

<a name="FNanchor122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>

<p>On the Brandstein in Styria, in the district of Gems, there is an
ice-hole closely resembling some of the glaci&egrave;res of the Jura. It
is described by Sartori,<a name="FNanchor123"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> as lying in a much-fissured region,
reached after four hours of steep ascent from the neighbouring village,
through a forest of fir. Some of the fissures contain water and some snow,
while others are apparently unfathomable. From one of the largest of
these, a strong and cold current blows in summer, and in this fissure is
the ice-hole. Sartori found <i>crimpons</i> necessary for descending the
frozen snow which led from the entrance to the floor of the cave, where he
discovered pillars and capitals and pyramids of ice of every possible
shape and variety, as if the cave had contained the ruins of a Gothic
church, or a fairy palace. At the farther end, after passing large
cascades of ice, his party reached a dark grey hole, which lighted up into
blue and green under the influence of the torches; they could not discover
the termination of this hole, and the stones which they rolled down into
it seemed to go on for ever. The greatest height of the cave is about 36
feet, and its length 192 feet, with a maximum breadth of 126 feet. Towards
the end of autumn, the temperature of the ice-hole rises <a name=
"Page_257"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;257]</span></a> so much, that
the glacial decorations disappear, and various wild animals are driven by
the cold of winter to take shelter in the comparative warmth of the cave.
The elevation of the district in which this ice-hole occurs is about 1,800
German feet above the sea.</p>

<p>In Upper Styria, where the Frauenmauer overlooks the basin in which the
mining town of Eisenerz is situated, an ice-cave has been explored, and a
description of it has been given by certain members of the Austrian Alpine
Club.<a name="FNanchor124"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a> The Brandstein is spoken of as one of
the peaks in the immediate neighbourhood; and as the cave previously
described is stated by Sartori to be on the Brandstein, that district
would seem to be rich in glaci&egrave;res. The cavern is most easily
explored from Eisenerz, and on that side the entrance is 4,539 Vienna feet
above the sea. Its other outlet, in the Trag&ouml;ss valley, is 300 feet
higher. The total length of the cave is 2,040 Vienna feet. After passing
the entrance, which is an archway from 12 to 18 feet high, the main course
of the cave is soon left, and a branch is followed which leads to the <i>
Eis-kammer</i>. This ice-chamber consists of a grotto from 30 to 40
fathoms long, decked with ice-crystals, pillars of ice, and cascades of
the same material, the floor being composed of ice as smooth as glass. In
the summer, pleasure-parties assemble in the cave and amuse themselves
with the game of <i>Eisschiessen</i>, so popular in Upper Styria as a
winter diversion. The hotter the summer, the more ice is found in the
Eiskammer, and the general belief is that it all disappears in winter.</p>

<p>The cave proper, which assumes stupendous dimensions in its long
course, shows no ice. It seems to be formed in the Muschelkalk of the
Trias <a name="Page_258"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;258]</span></a>
formation, and so far no limestone stalactites have been discovered. It
has not, however, as yet been fully explored. The editor of the
proceedings of the Austrian Alpine Club gives a reference to Scheiner,
'<i>Ausflug nach der H&ouml;hle der Frauenmauer,' (Steiermarkische
Zeitschrift, neue Folge</i>, i. 2, 1834, p. 3.)</p>

<p>At Latzenberg, near Weissenstein in Carniola, there is another
ice-cave, described by Rosenm&uuml;ller.<a name="FNanchor125"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> It is entered by a long dark passage
in which are pillars of ice arranged like the pipes of an organ, varying
from the thickness of a man's body to the size of a straw. All these are
said to melt in winter. Farther on are two other passages, one of which
passes upwards over <i>Stufe</i>, and is coated in summer with ice; the
other has not been explored.</p>

<p>Near Glaneck in the Untersberg, not far from Salzburg, is a cave called
the Kolowrath&ouml;hle, of which a description is given by G&uuml;mbel in
his great geological work on the Bavarian Alps.<a name=
"FNanchor126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> It is a
spacious cavern, opening in a steep wall of rock above the <i>
Rositenschlucht</i> between the Platten and <i>Dachstein-kalk.</i><a name=
"FNanchor127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> An
ice-current rushes from within, and ice is found on the threshold,
becoming more prevalent in the farther recesses of the cave. The lower
parts are tolerably roomy, and masses of ice of various shapes are found
piled one upon another, lighting up with magical effect when torches are
brought to bear upon them. G&uuml;mbel believes that the cold currents
which stream into the cave from the numerous fissures in its walls are the
cause of the ice; and though this is the only known ice-cave far and near,
he imagines that the icy-currents which are frequently met with in that
district, and in the <i>Hochgebirge</i>, would be found to proceed in
reality from like caves, if the fissures from which they blow could be
penetrated.</p>

<p>Behrens<a name="FNanchor128"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> describes two ice-caves near
Questenberg, in the county of <a name="Page_259"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;259]</span></a> Stollberg, on the Harz mountains. They both
occur in limestone, and are known as the Great and Little Ice-holes. The
one is close to the village of Questenberg, and consists of a chasm
several fathoms deep, so cold that in summer the water trickling down its
edges is frozen into long icicles. The opening is large and faces due
south, and yet the hotter the day the more ice is found; whereas in winter
a warm steam comes out, as if from a stove. The other cave is farther into
the mountain; it is spacious and light, and very cold in summer.</p>

<p>In Gehler's <i>Physik. W&ouml;rterbuch</i> (Art H&ouml;hle), a small
hole is mentioned near D&ocirc;le, which is said to be remarkable for the
large and curiously-shaped icicles found there; but no sufficient account
of it seems to have been given.</p>

<p>An ice-hole is also spoken of in the same article, which occurs on the
east side of the town of Vesoul.<a name="FNanchor129"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a> The hole is described as being small,
with a little rivulet of water: this water, and also that which trickles
down the walls of the cave, is converted into ice, and so much is formed
on a cold day that it requires eight warm days to melt it. Gollut, in his
description of the <i>fr&eacute;-puits</i> of Vesoul,<a name=
"FNanchor130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> observes
that the remarkable pit known by that name was so cold, that in his time
it had never been fully explored. Gehler's expression, however, 'a small
hole,' cannot possibly apply to the <i>fr&eacute;-puits</i>; so that these
would seem to be two different examples of cold caves near Vesoul.</p>

<p>There is an interesting account in Poggendorff's Annalen<a name=
"FNanchor131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> <a name=
"Page_260"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;260]</span></a> of a visit
made by Professor A. Pleischl to a mountain in the circle of Leitmeritz,
where ice is found in summer under very curious circumstances. The
mountain is called Pleschiwetz, and lies above Kameik, in Bohemia, not far
from the town of Leitmeritz. On the 24th of June in each year, large
numbers of pilgrims assemble at the romantic chapel of S. John the Baptist
in the Wilderness; and it is a part of their occupation to search for ice
under the basaltic rocks, and carry it home wrapped in moss, as a proof
that they have really made the pilgrimage. Professor Pleischl visited this
district at the end of May 1834. The weather was hot for the season, as
had been the case in April also, and there had been very little snow in
the winter. A path leads from the chapel of S. John through the woods
which deck the Pleschiwetz, and then over a small plain to the foot of the
basaltic rocks. Here the mountain slopes away very steeply to the south,
and the slope is thickly strewn with basaltic <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. From
east to west this slope measures about 40 fathoms, and its length is about
70 fathoms. It is surrounded on both sides and at the foot by trees and
shrubs. The sun burned so directly on to the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, that
the basaltic blocks were in some cases too hot to be touched by the naked
hand.</p>

<p>Professor Pleischl spent three hours of the early afternoon on this
spot. The upper surface of the basaltic blocks had a temperature of at
least 122&deg; F. The presence of an icy current was detected by inserting
the hand into the lower crevices; and on removing the loose stones to a
depth of 1-1/2 or 2 feet, ice was found in considerable quantities. On the
27th of August, he proceeded to make a further investigation of this
phenomenon; but he found the temperature of the blocks only 106&deg; F.,
and in the crevices, at a depth of 2 or 3 feet, the lowest temperature
reached was 38&deg;&middot;75 F. The external temperature in the shade was
at the <a name="Page_261"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;261]</span></a>
same time 83&deg; F.</p>

<p>A third visit, in January 1835, gave no results; but on January 21,
1838, the Professor succeeded in determining some very remarkable facts. A
depression in the sloping plain is called, <i>par excellence</i>, the
ice-hole; and this is surrounded by firs and birches, which grow within
three or four fathoms of the edge of the hole, so that the rays of the sun
do not reach the hole in winter. Fresh snow lay on these trees; and there
was nowhere any sign of melted snow, or of the formation of icicles. The
basaltic <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, in which ice had been found in the summer,
covers here a space of 5 fathoms long by 3 or 4 broad, immediately at the
foot of a steep basaltic precipice. At eleven in the morning the
temperature was 14&deg; F. in the shade; and snow lay all round the
ice-hole, to a thickness of 1-1/2 or 2 feet. The snow which covered the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> was pierced by holes, which could not have been
caused by the sun, for its rays did not penetrate the trees; and, indeed,
no sun had been visible for some days. These holes were generally turned
towards the north, and were like chimneys. On investigation, it was found
that icicles hung down into them, showing, of course, past or present
thaw, and within the cavities no ice was found. The thermometer gave here
from 27&deg;&middot;5 F. to 25&deg;&middot;15 F.; but in the crevices,
into which the thermometer could not be pushed, the hand discovered a warm
air. The moss drawn from these crevices was found to be steeped in
unfrozen water, and it froze promptly when brought into the outer air.</p>

<p>The party afterwards climbed up the precipitous basalt, and reached, at
3 P.M., a level covered with large blocks of the same material, where the
thermometer was slightly under 12&deg; F. in the shade. The blocks were
for the most part stripped of snow, and in some cases thin shields of ice
were observed standing out two or three inches from them, forming <a name=
"Page_262"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;262]</span></a> hollow
chambers, in which an agreeable warmth was found. These shields were
invariably on the south side of the stones, the north side being free from
ice and snow alike. In some places vapours were seen to rise. The
thermometer gave 41&deg; F. at a depth of six inches among the stones,
though the external temperature, as has been said, was 12&deg; F. For
eight days previously, the thermometer had been always far below the
freezing point, and on the 17th (four days before) had been 13&deg; below
zero (F.). On the 19th and 20th heavy snow had fallen. All these facts
seem to show that the warmth which had caused the chimneys in the snow
over the ice-holes, and the heated vapours on the higher parts of the
mountains, proceeded from within, and not from without.</p>

<p>The people of the district assured Professor Pleischl that the hotter
the summer, the more ice is formed; and that it disappears when the nights
become long and the days short. Dr. Weiss, for six years head of the
Gymnasium of Leitmeritz, stated that when one of the holes was emptied of
ice in the summer, it filled again in a few days. The explanation given by
the Professor of this phenomenon is, that the blocks of basalt, that being
an excellent conductor of heat, pass so much warmth through to their under
surfaces--which form the roof of small chambers filled with a spongy mass
of decaying leaves--that the rapid evaporation thereby caused produces the
cold air and the ice. He omits to explain why there should be anything
exceptional in the winter phenomenon of the crevices among the stones.</p>

<p>There are two other places in Bohemia where ice is found in summer. One
is on the Steinberg, in the county of Konaged;<a name="FNanchor132"></a><a
href="#Footnote_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> it is a small basin, surrounded
by trees, where, in the middle of summer, lumps of ice are found under
basaltic <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. This ice is only formed, according to <a
name="Page_263"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;263]</span></a> Sommer,
in the hottest part of the year. The other is on the Zinkenstein, one of
the highest points of the Vierzehnberg, in the circle of Leitmeritz. It is
described by Sommer<a name="FNanchor133"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> as a cleft, five fathoms deep, in the
basaltic rock, where ice is found in the hottest seasons. Professor
Pleischl put this assertion to the test by visiting the spot in the end of
August, when he found no signs of ice.</p>

<p>Another writer in Poggendorff<a name="FNanchor134"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> describes a somewhat similar
appearance on the Saalberg. Here ice is found on the surface from June to
the middle of August; and that, too, with a west exposure and in moderate
shade. In July, the ice was so abundant that it could be seen from some
distance: it was half a foot thick, and yielded neither to sun nor rain.
In the middle of August there was no ice on the surface; but when the
loose <i>d&eacute;bris</i> was removed, the most beautiful ice appeared,
and at a little depth all was frozen as hard as if it had been the depth
of winter.<a name="FNanchor135"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> The people who work in the
neighbourhood declare that the place remains open, and free from ice or
snow, in the greatest cold, and that no ice begins to form till the month
of June. When the writer of the account in Poggendorff visited the
ice-hole, the peasants were in the habit of carrying large masses of ice
down to their houses, through a temperature of 81&deg; F.</p>

<p>Reich<a name="FNanchor136"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> <a name="Page_264"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;264]</span></a> gives a detailed and valuable account
of the prevalence of subterranean ice on the Sauberg, a hill which forms
one side of a ravine near Ehrenfriedersdorf. The surface is about 2,000
feet above the sea, and its mean temperature, as determined by many
careful observations, about 45&deg; F. There are several tin-mines in this
district, and the extended observations made by the authorities establish
the curious fact that the mean temperature is considerably lower beneath
than at the surface. For instance, in the S. Christoph pit, it is found
that the mean temperature, at 15 fathoms below the surface, is only
slightly above 42&deg; F.; while at the Morgenr&ouml;ther cross-cut the
same mean temperature is found at a depth of 46 fathoms. The annual change
of temperature is very small in these mines, and the maximum and minimum
are reached very late; so that, if a point could be found with a mean
temperature of 32&deg; F., ice would increase there up to June or even
July, and then diminish until December or January; in which case the
phenomenon so often said to be observed in connection with subterranean
ice--the melting in winter and forming in summer--would really be
presented.</p>

<p>The ice on the Sauberg is frequently found to commence at a depth of 3
or 4 fathoms, and in the years 1811 and 1813 it extended to 24 fathoms
below the surface: this depth, however, was exceptionally great, and as a
rule the limit is reached at about 14 fathoms.<a name="FNanchor137"></a><a
href="#Footnote_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> The ice is usually not very
firm, and can be broken by stout blows with a stick; but between the years
1790 and 1800, when it was found at a depth of from 3 to 9 fathoms, it was
so hard that blasting became necessary, and at that time the miners were
with difficulty protected from the effects of the <a name="Page_265"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;265]</span></a> severe cold. The greatest
quantity of ice is found in the interstices of the rubbish-beds of old
workings, and here it assumes a crystalline form, the rocks being covered
with a 'fibrous' structure, arranged perpendicularly to their surface.</p>

<p>Reich reports the universal presence of cold currents of air in these
shafts and mines, and, in consequence, takes the opportunity of
contradicting a statement in Horner's <i>Physik. W&ouml;rterbuch,</i><a
name="FNanchor138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a> that
the absence of all current of air is essential to the formation of
subterranean ice. He quotes the case of the cheese-caves of Roquefort as a
further confirmation of his own observations with regard to the connection
between ice in caves and cold currents of air; but of the many accounts
which I have met with of the curious caves referred to, both in books and
from the lips of those who have visited them, not one has made any mention
of ice.<a name="FNanchor139"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> He states, too, that when the
strength of the current is diminished, its temperature is increased; a
fact which all observations of the cold currents in caves, especially
those made <a name="Page_266"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;266]</span></a> with so much care by M. Saussure, abundantly
establish.</p>

<p>In the way of explanation, Reich mentions the possibility of rocks of
peculiar formation possessing actually a low degree of temperature;<a
name="FNanchor140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> but he
rejects this suggestion, preferring to believe that in some cases the cold
resulting from evaporation is the cause of ice, and in others the greater
specific gravity of cold as compared with warmer air.</p>

<p>In the <i>Bulletin des Sciences Naturelles</i>,<a name=
"FNanchor141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a> it is
stated that a large quantity of ice is found in one of the recesses of the
grotto of Antiparos--a fact which I have not seen mentioned elsewhere.
After penetrating a long way through difficult fissures, a square chamber
is at length reached, measuring 300 feet in length and breadth, with a
height of about 80 feet. The walls and roof and floor are beautifully
decorated with ice, and reflect all the colours of the rainbow. There are
groups of pyramidal and round columns, and in some parts of the cave
screens or curtains of ice 10 or 12 feet broad hang down to the floor.</p>

<p>In a later volume of the same periodical,<a name="FNanchor142"></a><a
href="#Footnote_142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> there is a description of a hill
in Virginia where ice is found in summer. This hill lies near the road
between Winchester and Romney, on the North River, latitude 39&ordm; N.
One side of the hill is entirely composed of loose stones from ten to <a
name="Page_267"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;267]</span></a> twenty
pounds in weight, and under these the ice is found, although their upper
surface is exposed to the full sun from 9 or 10 A.M. till sunset. In all
seasons there is an abundance of ice. A writer in the 'London and Paris
Observer'<a name="FNanchor143"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> visited the spot on the 4th of July,
after a time of stifling heat, and in ten minutes he found more ice than
the whole party could have carried away. He did not explore any farther
than the foot of the hill; but the neighbours, who used the ice regularly
in summer, assured him that it was to be found high up also. A constant
and strong current issued from the crevices, stronger and infinitely
colder than the current in the famous 'blowing cave' of Virginia. A man
had built a store-room for meat within the influence of one of these
currents, and hard dry icicles were seen hanging from the wooden supports
inside: the flies, too, which had been attracted by the meat, were found
frozen on to the stones. This is not the only district where ice is found
within temperate latitudes in North America. In Professor Silliman's
'American Journal of Science,'<a name="FNanchor144"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> in a sketch of the geology of the
township of Salisbury, Con. (latitude 43&deg; N.), 'natural ice-houses'
are mentioned. These consist of chasms of considerable extent in the
mica-state, where ice and snow remain during the greater part of the year.
The principal of these chasms lies in the east part of the town, and is
several hundred feet long, sixty feet deep, and about forty wide. The
slate is of a very compact kind; and the walls are perpendicular, and
correspond with much exactness. At the bottom is a cold spring, and a cave
of considerable extent, in which it is probable that the ice lies--for the
writer does not specify the position in which it is found. The chasm is a
favourite retreat in summer, and is called the Wolf-hollow, from its
having formerly been a famous haunt for wolves.</p>

<a name="Page_268"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;268]</span></a>

<p>Similar receptacles for summer-ice are found in several places in North
America. In the forty-ninth volume of the <i>Sitzungsberichte der Kaiserl.
Akademie in Wien</i> (1te. Abth.), a list of references to various
ice-holes is appended to a paper by Dr. Bou&eacute; on the geology of
Servia. Many of the passages referred to have nothing to do with
ice-caves, as, for instance, the sections of De Saussure's book describing
his observations of 'cold caves', or the account of the mass of ice and
snow from which the river Jumna springs, for which Dr. Bou&eacute; refers
to the 'Philosophical Magazine' for November 1823, meaning, in fact, the
'London Magazine'. The 'Description des Glaci&egrave;res' of M. Bourrit is
also given as a part of the literature on ice-caves; whereas (see the
account of the Glaci&egrave;re of Montarquis, in the Valley of Reposoir)
by 'glaci&egrave;re' M. Bourrit meant only a locality where ice is to be
found, or a glacier district. Dr. Bou&eacute;, however, gives some
references to the 'American Journal of Science' which it is possible to
make out by a careful search in the neighbourhood of the volume and page
he mentions. In vol. iv. (1822,--Dr. Bou&eacute; says 1821) there is an
account by the editor<a name="FNanchor145"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a> of a natural ice-house in the
township of Meriden, Con., between Hartford and Newhaven, at an elevation
of not more than 200 feet above the level of the sea. The ice is found in
a narrow defile, which is hemmed in by perpendicular sides of trap-rock,
and displays a perfect chaos of fallen blocks of stone. The defile is so
narrow, that the sun's rays only reach it for an hour in the course of the
day; and even the trees and rocks, and beds of leaves, protect the ice
from any very material damage. Dr. Silliman visited this defile on the
23rd July, 1821,<a name="FNanchor146"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a> with Dr. Isaac Hough, the keeper of a
neighbouring inn, and found that the ice was only <a name="Page_269"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;269]</span></a> partially visible, in
consequence of the large collection of leaves which lay on it: they sent a
boy down with a hatchet, and he brought up some large firm masses, one of
which, weighing several pounds, they carried twenty miles to Newhaven,
where it did not entirely disappear till the morning of the third day.
Seven miles from Newhaven, in the township of Branford, there is a similar
collection of ice. In both of these cases, the ice is mixed with a
considerable quantity of leaves and dirt.</p>

<p>In the same volume (p. 331,--Dr. Bou&eacute; says p. 33), two accounts
are given of a natural ice-house near the summit of a hill in the
neighbourhood of Williamstown (Mass.). In the next volume there is a
further account of it by Professor Dewey, stating that since the trees in
the neighbourhood had been cut, the snow and ice had disappeared each year
about the first of August.</p>

<p>In vol. xlvi. (p. 331) an ice mountain in Wallingford, Rutland County
(Vt.), is described, which is ordinarily known in the neighbourhood as the
ice-bed. An area of thirty or fifty acres of ground is covered with
massive <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of grey quartz from the mountains which
overhang it; and here--especially in a deep ravine into which many of the
falling blocks of stone have penetrated--ice is found in large quantities.
It appears to be formed during the melting of the snow in February, March,
and April, and vanishes in the course of the summer, in hot years as early
as the last days of June.</p>

<p>These descriptions call to mind the Glaci&egrave;re of Arc-sous-Cicon,
in which many of the features of the American ice-caves are reproduced. An
American photograph is current in this country, in the form of a
stereoscopic slide, representing an ice-cave in the White Mountains, New
Hampshire; but it is only a winter cave, and in no way resembles any of
the glaci&egrave;res I have seen. It is merely a <a name="Page_270"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;270]</span></a> collection of long and slender
icicles, with beds of ice formed upon stones and trunks of trees on the
ground; nothing more, in fact, than is to be seen in any tolerably severe
winter in the neighbourhood of a cascade in a sheltered Scotch burn.</p>

<p>The 'American Journal of Science' (xxxvi. 184) gives a curious instance
of a freezing-well near the village of Owego, three-quarters of a mile
from the Susquehanna river. The depth of the well is 77 feet, and for four
or five months in the year the surface of the water is frozen so hard as
to render the well useless. Large masses of ice have been found in it late
in July. A thermometer, which stood at 68&deg; in the sun, fell to 30&deg;
in fifteen minutes at the bottom of the well; and the men who made the
well were forced to put on thick clothing in June, and even so could not
work for more than two hours at a time. No other well in that
neighbourhood presents the same phenomenon. A lighted candle was let down,
and the flame became agitated and thrown in one direction at a depth of 30
feet, but was quite still at the bottom; where, however, it soon died out.
The water is hard or limestone water.</p>

<p>Rocks of volcanic formation would seem to afford favourable
opportunities for the formation of ice. Scrope mentions this fact in an
account of the curious district called Eiffel or Eifel, in Rhenish
Prussia, which was published originally in the 'Edinburgh Journal of
Science,'<a name="FNanchor147"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> and has since been translated in
Keferstein's Deutschland.<a name="FNanchor148"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a> The village of Roth, near Andernach,
is built on a current of basalt, derived from the cone above it, which has
at some time sent down a stream of lava to the north and west. A small
cavern near the village, forming the mouth of a deep fissure in the
lava-stream, half-way up the cone, displays a phenomenon which the writer
says he has often <a name="Page_271"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;271]</span></a> observed in volcanic formations. The floor of
the cavern was covered with a crust of ice at the time of his visit, about
noon on a very hot day in August. The peasants report that there is always
ice in summer, and never in winter, when the sheep retreat to the cave on
account of its warmth. Steininger<a name="FNanchor149"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> found a thickness of 3 feet of ice on
September 19, 1818, but it was evidently in a melting state, and the
thermometer stood at 36&middot;5 F. in the cavern. He describes it as
possessing a narrow entrance facing north, entirely sheltered from the sun
by lava-rocks, and by the trees of a wood which covers the cone of
scoria.</p>

<p>Scrope believes that this is the mouth of one of the arched galleries
so frequently met with under lava in Iceland, Bourbon, and elsewhere; and
on this he founds his explanation of the phenomenon. If the other
extremity is connected with the external air at a much lower level, a
current of air must be constantly driven up this gallery, and in its
passage will be dried by the absorbent nature of the rock--which is
perhaps partly owing to the sulphuric or muriatic acid it contains<a name=
"FNanchor150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>--- and the
evaporation caused by this current produces a coating of ice on the floor
of the grotto, where there is a superficial rill of water. The more
rarified the lower external air, the more rapid will be the current of
cool air; and, therefore, the greater the evaporation. The winter
phenomenon is to be explained by the fact that the current of air will be
about the mean annual temperature of the district, taking its temperature,
in fact, from the rocks through which it passes; and, therefore, by
contrast the grotto will appear warm.</p>

<p>The same writer mentions a similar example of summer ice in <a name=
"Page_272"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;272]</span></a> Auvergne.<a
name="FNanchor151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> There
is a natural grotto in the basalt near Pont Gibaud, some miles to the
north-west of Clermont, in which a small spring is found partly frozen
during the greatest heats of summer, while the water is said to be warm in
winter; probably, Scrope observes, only seeming to be warm by contrast
with the external temperature. The water is apparently frozen by means of
the powerful evaporation produced by a current of very dry air proceeding
from some long fissures or arched galleries which communicate with the
cave. In this case also the writer suggests that the air owes its dryness
to the absorbent qualities of the lava through which it passes: he
repeats, too, the remark that the phenomenon is of common occurrence in
caverns in volcanic districts.<a name="FNanchor152"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p>There is a remarkable instance of ice occurring under lava, near the
<i>Casa Inglese</i> on Mount Etna, which it may be as well to mention,
though the causes of its existence have probably nothing in common with
the phenomena of ice-caves, or summer ice. An account of it is to be found
in Sir Charles Lyell's 'Elements of Geology.'<a name="FNanchor153"></a><a
href="#Footnote_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> It appears that the summer and
autumn of 1828 were so hot, that the artificial ice-houses of Catania and
the adjoining parts of Sicily failed. Signer M. Gemmellaro had long
believed that a small mass of perennial ice at the foot of the highest
cone of Etna was only a part of a large and continuous glacier covered by
a lava current, and from this he expected to derive an abundant supply of
ice. He procured a large body of workmen, and quarried into the ice; but
though <a name="Page_273"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;273]</span></a>
he thus proved the superposition of lava for several hundred yards, the
ice was so hard, and the expense of quarrying consequently so great, that
the works were abandoned. This was on the south-east of the cone, not far
from the <i>Casa Inglese</i>. Sir Charles Lyell suggests that, probably,
at the commencement of some eruption, a large mass of snow has been
thickly covered with volcanic sand, showered upon it before the arrival of
the lava itself. This sand is a non-conductor of heat, and would therefore
tend to preserve the snow from complete fusion when the hot lava-stream
passed over it, and thus the existence of the underground glacier may be
explained. The peasants of the district are so well acquainted with the
non-conducting properties of volcanic sand, that they secure an annual
store of snow, for providing water in summer, by strewing a layer of sand
a few inches thick upon a field of snow, thus effectually shutting out the
heat of the sun. It is curious that when De Saussure visited Chamouni for
the first time, his attention was arrested by the sight of women sowing
what seemed to be grain of some kind in the snow; but, on enquiring, he
found that it was only black earth, which the inhabitants spread on the
snow in spring, in order to make it disappear sooner. He was told that
snow thus treated would melt a fortnight or three weeks before the
ordinary time for its disappearance in the valley; but it will be seen
that this does not contradict the theory of the Sicilian peasants.<a name=
"FNanchor154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p>Sir Charles Lyell adds that, after what he saw on Mount Etna, he should
not be surprised to find layers of glacier and lava alternating in some
parts of Iceland.</p>

<a name="Page_274"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;274]</span></a>

<p>Something similar was observed by Von Kotzebue, near the sound which
bears his name.<a name="FNanchor155"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> His party was encamped on a large
plain covered with moss and grass, when they discovered a fissure which
revealed the fact that the moss and grass were but a thin coating on a
layer of ice a hundred feet thick. This was not mere frozen ground, but
aboriginal ice; for, in the ice which formed the walls of the fissure,
they found the bones and teeth of mammoths embedded.</p>

<p>The frozen soil of Jakutsk, in Siberia, has for many years attracted
considerable attention. The ordinary law of increase of temperature in
descending below the surface of the earth would appear, however, to be
only modified here; for it is found in sinking a well which has afforded
opportunities for observing the state of the soil, that the temperature
gradually increases with the depth.<a name="FNanchor156"></a><a href=

<p>Two ice-caverns were examined by Georgi, in the course of his travels
in Russia.<a name="FNanchor157"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> One occurs near the mines of
Lurgikan, on the east side of a hill about 450 feet high, not far from the
confluence of the Lurgikan stream with <a name="Page_275"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;275]</span></a> the Schilka (a tributary of the
Amur), in the province of Nertschinsk. In the course of driving an adit in
one of the lead-mines, in the year 1770, the workmen were struck by the
hollow sound given forth by the rock, and, on investigation, they found an
immense grotto or fissure, of which the entrance was so much blocked up by
ice that they had much difficulty in sliding down by means of ropes. The
fissure extended under the hill, in a direction from north to south, and
was 130 fathoms long, from 1 to 8 broad, and from 3 to 12 high. Where it
approached nearest the surface, the thickness of the roof was about 10
fathoms. The rock is described by Georgi as <i>quarzig, br&auml;unlich,
und von einem starken Kalkschuss</i>. He found the greater part of the
walls covered with ice, and many pillars and pyramids of ice on the floor.
The cold was moderate, and was said to be much the same in summer and
winter. Patrin has given a fuller description of the same cavern in the
<i>Journalde Physique</i>.<a name="FNanchor158"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> The lead-mine is in limestone rock,
containing a third part of clay. The entrance to the glaci&egrave;re was
still difficult at the time of his visit, and it was necessary to use a
rope, and also to cut steps, for the descent was made along a ridge of ice
with almost perpendicular sides. The spectacle presented by the decoration
of the roof was remarkably beautiful, long festoons and tufts of ice
hanging down, light and brilliant as silver gauze: this ice was supposed
to be formed from the abundant vapours of the beginning of winter, and
resembled glass blown to the utmost tenuity. It was crystallised, too, in
a wonderful manner. Patrin found long bundles of hexahedral tubes, the
walls of which were formed of transverse needles: the diameter of these
tubes was from two to six lines only, but at the lower extremities they
opened out into hollow six-sided <a name="Page_276"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;276]</span></a> pyramids, more than an inch in diameter, so
that the festoons, sometimes as large round as a man, presented terminal
tufts of some feet in diameter, which glittered like diamonds under the
influence of the torches. Towards the farther end of the fissure,
stalactites of solid ice were found, displaying all the forms and more
than all the beauty of limestone stalactites. The other instance mentioned
by Georgi occurred in the mines of Serentvi, where two of the levels
yielded perennial ice, and were thence (Georgi says) called <i>
Ledenoi</i>. A spring of water flowed from the rock at a depth of thirty
fathoms below the surface, and was promptly frozen into a coating of ice a
foot thick. Patrin<a name="FNanchor159"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a> visited Serentvi, but he did not
observe any ice in the mines. He believed the rock to be very ancient
lava.</p>

<p>Reich<a name="FNanchor160"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> mentions a cavern on Mount Sorano
which contains ice, quoting Kircher;<a name="FNanchor161"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> but he seems to have misinterpreted
his author's Latin.<a name="FNanchor162"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> He also refers to the existence of
ice in the mines of Herrengrund in Hungary, and Dannemora in Sweden.
Kircher, who has the credit of having been the first to call attention to
the increase of temperature in the earth, made full enquiries into the
temperature of the mines at Herrengrund, but he was not informed of the
existence of ice.<a name="FNanchor163"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> Townson visited these <a name=
"Page_277"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;277]</span></a> mines in the
course of his travels in Hungary, and neither does he make any mention of
ice in connection with them. He describes them as lying south of Teplitz,
in a limestone district, with sandstone in the more immediate
neighbourhood. The mines themselves (copper mines) are in a kind of
mica-schist, which the people call granite. The superintendent of mines
informed Reich that one of the shafts is called the ice-mine, from the
fact that when the workmen attempted to drive a gallery from south to
north, they came upon ice filling up the interstices of the <i>
Haldenstein</i>, within five fathoms of the commencement of the gallery.
The temperature was so low, and the expense caused by the frozen mass so
great, that the working was stopped.</p>

<p>The iron mines of Dannemora, eleven leagues from Upsal, contain a large
quantity of ice, according to a manuscript account by Mr.
Over-assessor-of-the-board-of-mines Winkler:<a name="FNanchor164"></a><a
href="#Footnote_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> Jars, however, in his <i>Voyages
M&eacute;tallurgiques</i>,<a name="FNanchor165"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a> gives a full description of them
without mentioning the existence of ice. He states that ice is found in
the mines of Nordmarck, three leagues from Philipstadt in Wermeland, a
province of Sweden: these mines are merely numerous shafts sunk in the
earth, reaching to the bottom of the vein of ore, so that they are fully
exposed to the light, and yet the walls of the shafts become covered with
ice at the end of winter, which remains there till the middle of
September. Jars believed that, if it were not for the heat caused by
blasting, and by the presence of the workmen, the ice would be perennial.
Humboldt<a name="FNanchor166"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> speaks of the ice in these mines and
on the Sauberg. Reich states that ice is found in the mill-stone quarry of
Nieder-Mendig, quoting Karsten's <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Bergbau</i>.<a name=
"FNanchor167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a> The ice is
found in the hottest days of summer, although <a name="Page_278"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;278]</span></a> the interior of the quarry is
connected with the outer air by many side shafts. The porous nature of the
stone is assigned as the cause of the phenomenon. Daubeny (On Volcanoes)
describes the remarkable basaltic deposits at Niedermennig--as he spells
it--but says nothing of the existence of ice.</p>

<p>Daubuisson<a name="FNanchor168"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> speaks of a <i>Schneegrube</i>, on a
summit of the <i>Riesengebirge</i>, in Silesia, 4,000 feet above the sea;
but such holes are common enough at that elevation, and I have seen two or
three remarkable instances on the Jura, within the compass of one day's
walk. Voigt<a name="FNanchor169"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> describes an <i>Eisgrube</i> in the
Rh&ouml;ngebirge, on the <i>Ringmauer</i>, the highest point of the <i>
Tagstein</i>, where abundant ice is found in summer under irregular masses
of columnar basalt. Reich had received from a forest-inspector an account
of an ice-hole in this neighbourhood, called <i>Umpfen</i>, which is
apparently not the same as that mentioned by Voigt.</p>

<p>In the Saxon Erzgebirge there are three points remarkable for their low
temperature,<a name="FNanchor170"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a> in addition to the mines on the
Sauberg mentioned above. These are the <i>Heinrichssohle</i>, in the
Stockwerk at Altenberg, where the mean of two years' observations gives
the temperature 0&deg;&middot;54 F. lower at a depth of 400 feet than at
the surface; the adit of <i>Henneberg</i>, on the Ingelbach, near
Johanngeorgenstadt, where the temperature was again 0&deg;&middot;54 F.
lower than in shafts some hundred feet higher; and the <i>Weiss Adler</i>
adit, on the left declivity of the valley of the Schwarzwasser, above the
Antonsh&uuml;tte. It would appear that there are local causes which affect
the temperature in the Erzgebirge, for Reich found that in several places
the mean <a name="Page_279"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;279]</span></a> temperature of the soil was higher than that of
the air: for instance--</p>

<p>The temperature at Markus R&ouml;hling is peculiarly anomalous,
considering the elevation of the surface above the sea.</p>

<p>There is said to be an ice-cave in Nassau, but I have been unable to
obtain any account of it, unless it be the same as the <i>ice-field</i>
mentioned on page 303.</p>

<p>There is a cave in the south-east of Hungary<a name=
"FNanchor171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> which
presents the same features as several of the glaci&egrave;res I have
visited. It is called the Ice-hole of Scherisciora, and is described as
lying in the Jura-kalk, at a distance of 2-1/2 hours north-east from the
forest-house of Distidiul. The approach is by ladders, down a pit 30
fathoms wide and 24 deep; and when the bottom of this pit is reached, an
entrance is found to the cave in the north wall, in the neighbourhood of
which is congealed snow which shortly becomes ice. The floor of the first
chamber is composed of glacier-ice, separated from the side walls by a
cleft from 1 to 3 feet wide, where it shows a depth of from 4 to 6 feet;
it is as smooth as glass, and about 6 fathoms from the entrance a cone of
ice stands upon it, 8 or 9 feet high. Both the floor and the cone are at
once seen to be transformed remains of ancient masses of snow, and are of
a dirty yellow colour.</p>

<p>At the back of this chamber, a narrow passage opens towards the
interior of the mountain, and winds steeply down with a height of 4 feet,
and a length of a few <a name="Page_280"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;280]</span></a> fathoms, till a magnificent dome is reached, on
the beauties of which Herr Peters becomes eloquent. The floor is so smooth
that crimpons are necessary, and stalagmites and stalactites of ice are
found in rich profusion, the latter being generally formed on small
limestone stalactites, while the former have no such nucleus.</p>

<p>There is another opening near the original entrance to the cave, a sort
of fissure covered with elegant forms of ice, leading to a steep shaft.
The imperial forester of Topfanalva was bold enough to let himself down
the slope of ice which formed the edge of the shaft, on a rope ladder 60
feet long, notwithstanding the difficulty of grasping the iron steps which
of course lay pressed on to the ice; but when he had descended about 30
feet, the shaft became perpendicular, and stones thrown in showed a very
considerable depth. There appeared to be no sound of water in the abyss
below.</p>

<p>Both entrances, that to the shaft as well as that to the second
chamber, were ornamented with delicate ice crystals, which occurred both
on the limestone stalactites and on the walls, and presented almost the
appearance of plants of cauliflower. The ice-floor of the first chamber is
described as consisting of a 'coarse-grained' material.</p>

<p>In the south-east of Servia, on the western slope of Mount Rtagn, is a
pit 20 feet in diameter, and 40 or 50 feet deep, the bottom of which is
reached by a succession of trunks of trees with the branches lopped off, a
sort of ladder called <i>stouba</i> by the natives.<a name=
"FNanchor172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> The
peasants assert that the snow and ice disappear from this pit in
September, and do not reappear before June. The Swiss peasants have never
yet got so far as to say that the <i>snow</i> in their pits disappears in
winter and returns in summer. Bou&eacute;<a name="FNanchor173"></a><a
href="#Footnote_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> found <a name="Page_281"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;281]</span></a> the temperature of the bottom
of the pit to be 28&deg;&middot;4 F., while that of the air outside was
76&deg; F. The same writer<a name="FNanchor174"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> mentions a source in a mill-stone
quarry in Bosnia which is frozen till the end of June.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<a name="Page_282"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;282]</span></a>

<h3>HISTORY OF THEORIES RESPECTING THE CAUSES OF SUBTERRANEAN ICE.</h3>

<p>The only glaci&egrave;re which is in any sense historical, is that near
Besan&ccedil;on; and a brief account of the different theories which have
been advanced in explanation of the phenomena presented by it, will
include almost all that has been written on ice-caves.</p>

<p>The first mention I have found of this cave is contained in an old
history of the Franche Comt&eacute; of Burgundy, published at D&ocirc;le
in 1592, to which reference has been already made. Gollut, the author,
speaks more than once of a <i>glaci&egrave;re</i> in his topographical
descriptions, and in a short account of it he states that it lay near the
village of <i>Leugn&eacute;</i>, which I find marked in the Delphinal
Atlas very near the site of the Chartreuse of Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu; so that
there can be no doubt that his glaci&egrave;re was the same with that
which now exists. His theory was, that the dense covering of trees and
shrubs protected the soil and the surface-water from the rays of the sun,
and so the cold which was stored up in the cave was enabled to withstand
the attacks of the heat of summer.<a name="FNanchor175"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> In the case of many <a name=
"Page_283"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;283]</span></a> of the
glaci&egrave;res, there can be no doubt that this idea of winter cold
being so preserved, by natural means, as to resist the encroachments of
the hotter seasons, is the true explanation of the phenomenon of
underground ice.</p>

<p>The next account of this glaci&egrave;re is found in the History of the
Royal Academy of Sciences (French), under the year 1686,<a name=
"FNanchor176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> but no
theory is there suggested. The writer of the account states that in his
time the floor of the cave was covered with ice, and that ice hung from
the roof in festoons. In winter the cave was full of thick vapours, and a
stream of water ran through it. The ice had for long been less abundant
than in former times, in consequence of the felling of some trees which
had stood near the entrance.</p>

<p>The Academy received in the same year another letter on this subject,
confirming the previous account, and adding some particulars. From this it
would seem that people flocked from all sides to the glaci&egrave;re with
waggons and mules, and conveyed the ice through the various parts of
Burgundy, and to the camp of the Saone; not thereby diminishing the amount
of ice, for one hot day produced as much as they could carry away in eight
days. The ice seemed to be formed from a stream which ran through the cave
and was frozen in the summer only. The writer of this second account saw
vapours in the glaci&egrave;re (the editor of the <i>Histoire de
l'Acad&eacute;mie</i> does not say at what season the visit to the cave
took place), and was informed that <a name="Page_284"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;284]</span></a> this was an infallible sign of
approaching rain; so much so, that the peasants were in the habit of
determining the coming weather by the state of the grotto.</p>

<p>In 1712, M. Billerez, Professor of Anatomy and Botany in the University
of Besan&ccedil;on, communicated to the Academy<a name=
"FNanchor177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> an account
of a visit made by him to this cave in September 1711. He found 3 feet of
ice on the floor of the cave, in a state of incipient thaw, and three
pyramids, from 15 to 20 feet high and 5 or 6 feet in diameter, which had
been already considerably reduced in size by thaw. A vapour was beginning
to pass out from the cave, at the highest part of the arch of entrance; a
phenomenon which, he was told, continued through the winter, and announced
or accompanied the departure of the ice: nevertheless, the cold was so
great that he could not remain in the glaci&egrave;re more than half an
hour with any sort of comfort. The thermometer stood at 60&deg; outside
the cave, and fell to 10&deg;<a name="FNanchor178"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a> when placed inside; but
thermometrical observations of that date were so vague as to be useless
for present purposes. The ice appeared to be harder than the ordinary ice
of rivers, less full of air-bubbles, and more difficult to melt.</p>

<p>M. Billerez enunciated a new theory to account for the phenomena
presented by the cave. He observed that the earth in the immediate
neighbourhood, and especially above the roof of the grotto, was full of a
nitrous or ammoniac salt, and he accordingly suggested that this salt was
disturbed by the heat of summer and mingled itself with the water which
penetrated by means of fissures to the grotto, and so the cave was
affected in the same way as the smaller vessel in the ordinary preparation
of artificial ice. He had heard <a name="Page_285"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;285]</span></a> that some rivers in China freeze in summer from
the same cause.<a name="FNanchor179"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1726, a further communication was made to the Academy by M. des
Boz,<a name="FNanchor180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>
Royal Engineer, describing four visits which he had made to the grotto
near Besan&ccedil;on at four different seasons of the year, viz., in May
and November 1725, and in March and August 1726. In all cases he found the
air in the cave colder than the external air,<a name="FNanchor181"></a><a
href="#Footnote_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> and its variations in
temperature corresponded with the external variations, the cold being
greater in winter than in summer.</p>

<p>M. des Boz ascribed the existence of ice in the cave to natural causes.
The opening being towards the north-east, and corresponding with a gorge
in the hills opposite, running in the same direction, none but cold winds
could reach the mouth of the grotto. Moreover, the soil above was so
thickly covered with trees and brushwood, that the rays of the sun could
not reach the earth, much less the rock below. Credible persons asserted
that since some of the trees had been felled, there had not been so much
ice in the cave.</p>

<p>In order to test the presence of salt, M. des Boz melted some of the
ice, and evaporated the resulting water, but found no taste of salt in the
matter which remained.<a name="FNanchor182"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> He denied the existence of the spring
of water which previous accounts had mentioned, and believed that the
water which <a name="Page_286"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;286]</span></a> formed the ice came solely from melted snow,
and from the fissures of the rock.</p>

<p>In 1727, the Duc de L&eacute;vi caused the whole of the ice to be
removed from the cave, for the use of the army of the Saone, which he
commanded. In 1743 the ice had formed again, and the grotto was subjected
to a very careful investigation by M. de Cossigny, chief engineer of
Besan&ccedil;on, in the months of August and October.<a name=
"FNanchor183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> The
thermometer he used had been presented to him by the Academy, and was very
probably constructed by M. de R&eacute;aumur himself, for de Cossigny's
account was sent through M. de R&eacute;aumur to the Academy, but still
the observations made with it cannot be considered very trustworthy. On
the 8th of August, at 7.30 A.M., the temperature in the cave was 1/2&deg;
above the zero point of this thermometer, and at 11.30 A.M. it had risen
to 1&deg; above zero. On the 17th of October, at 7 A.M., the thermometer
stood at 1/2&deg;, and at 4 P.M. it gave the same register.</p>

<p>M. de Cossigny found that the entrance to the cave was rather more than
150 feet above the Abbey of Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu, and about half a league
distant by the ordinary path. A great part of his account is occupied by
contradictions of previous accounts, especially in the matter of
dimensions,<a name="FNanchor184"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a> The people of Besan&ccedil;on had
urged him to stay only a short time in the cave, because of the
sulphureous and nitrous exhalations, but he detected no symptoms of
anything of that kind. The most curious thing which he saw was the soft
earth which lay, and still lies, at the bottom of the long slope of ice by
which the descent is made; and he subjected this to various chemical tests
and processes, but could not find that <a name="Page_287"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;287]</span></a> it contained anything different from
ordinary earth.<a name="FNanchor185"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p>When M. de Cossigny visited the cave, there were thirteen or fourteen
columns of ice, from 6 to 8 feet high, and he was in consequence inclined
to doubt the accuracy of the statement of M. Billerez, that in his time
(1711) there were three columns only, from 15 to 20 feet high. But my own
observation of the shape of the columns suggested that the largest of all
was probably an amalgamation of several others; so that it is not
unreasonable to suppose that after the Duc de L&eacute;vi removed the
large columns seen by M. Billerez, a number of smaller columns were formed
on the old site, and that these had not become large enough to amalgamate
in 1743.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with these visits of August and October, M. de Cossigny
visited the cave in April 1745. He found the temperature at 5 A.M. to be
exactly at the freezing point, and at noon it had risen 1&deg;. From this
he concluded that the stories of the greater cold in the cave during the
summer, as compared with the winter, were false.</p>

<p>In 1769, M. Pr&eacute;vost, of Geneva, visited the cave, as a young
man; and in 1789, he wrote an account of his visit in the <i>Journal de
Gen&egrave;ve</i> (March), which was afterwards inserted as an additional
chapter in his book on Heat.<a name="FNanchor186"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> He believed that one or two hundred
<i>toises</i> was the utmost that could be allowed for the height of the
hill in which the glaci&egrave;re lies,--a sufficiently vague
approximation. He rejected the idea of salt as the cause of ice, and came
to the conclusion that the cave was in fact nothing more than a good
natural ice-house, being protected <a name="Page_288"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;288]</span></a> by dense trees, and a thick roof of
rock, while its opening towards the north sheltered it from all warm
winds. He accounted for the original presence of ice as follows:--In the
winter, stalactites form at the edges of various fissures in the roof, and
snow is drifted on to the floor of the cave by the north winds down the
entrance-slope. When the warmer weather comes, the stalactites fall by
their own weight, and, lying in the drifted and congealed snow, form
nuclei round which the snow is still further congealed, and the water
which results from the partial thaw of portions of the snow is also
converted into ice. Thus, a larger collection of ice forms in winter than
the heat of summer can destroy; and if none of it were removed, it might,
in the course of years, almost fill the cave. At the time of his visit
(August), M. Pr&eacute;vost found only one column, from 6 to 8 feet
high.</p>

<p>In 1783 (August 6), M. Girod-Chantrans visited the Glaci&egrave;re of
Chaux (so called from a village near the glaci&egrave;re, on the opposite
side from the Abbey of Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu), and his account of the visit
appeared in the <i>Journal des Mines</i><a name="FNanchor187"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> of Prairial, an iv., by which time
the writer had become the Citizen Girod-Chantrans. He found a mass of
stalactites of ice hanging from the roof, as if seeking to join themselves
with corresponding stalagmites on the floor of the cave; the latter, five
in number, being not more than 3 or 4 feet high, and standing on a thick
sheet of ice. There was a sensible interval between this basement of ice
and the rock and stones on which it reposed: it was, moreover, full of
holes containing water, and the lower parts of the cave were
unapproachable by reason of the large quantity of water which lay there.
The thermometer stood at 35&deg;&middot;9 F. two feet above the floor, and
at 78&deg; F. in the shade outside. M. Girod-Chantrans <a name="Page_289">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;289]</span></a> determined, from all he
saw and heard, that the summer freezing and winter thaw were fables, and
he believed that the cave was only an instance of Nature's providing the
same sort of receptacle for ice as men provide in artificial ice-houses.
He was fortunate enough to obtain by chance the notes of a neighbouring
physician, who had made careful observations and experiments in the
glaci&egrave;re at various seasons of the year, and a <i>pr&eacute;cis</i>
of these notes forms the most valuable part of his account.</p>

<p>Dr. Oudot, the physician in question, found ten columns in January
1778, the largest of which was 5-1/2 feet high. The flooring of ice was
nowhere more than 15 inches thick, and the parts of the rock which were
not covered with ice were perfectly dry. The thermometer--M.
Girod-Chantrans used R&eacute;aumur, so I suppose that he gives Dr.
Oudot's observations in degrees of R&eacute;aumur, though some of the
results of that supposition appear to be anomalous--gave 22&deg; F. within
the cave, and 21&deg; F. outside.</p>

<p>In April of the same year, the large column had increased in height to
the extent of 13 inches; and the floor of ice on which it stood was 1-1/2
inch thicker, and extended over a larger area than before; the thermometer
stood at 36&deg;&middot;5 F. and 52&deg; F. respectively in the same
positions as in the former case. In July, the large column had lost 6
inches of its height, and the thermometer gave 38&deg;&middot;75 F. and
74&deg;&middot;75 F.</p>

<p>In October, the large column was only 3 feet high, and many of the
others had disappeared, while their pedestal had become much thinner than
it had been in the preceding months. There was also a considerable amount
of mud in the cave, brought down apparently by the heavy rains of autumn.
The thermometer gave 37&deg;&middot;6 F. and 63&deg;&middot;5 F.</p>

<p>On the 8th of January, 1779, there were nine columns of very beautiful
ice, and one of these, as before, was larger <a name="Page_290"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;290]</span></a> than the rest, being 5 feet
high and 10 feet in circumference. The temperatures were 21&deg; F. and
16&deg;&middot;15 F. in the cave and in the open air respectively.</p>

<p>Tradition related that, before the removal of the ice in 1727, one of
the columns reached the roof, (Pr&eacute;vost calculated the limits of the
height of the cave at 90 and 60 feet,) and this suggested to Dr. Oudot the
idea of placing stakes of wood in the heads of the columns he found in the
cave, in the hope that ice would thus collect in greater quantities under
the fissures of the roof. Accordingly, he made holes in three of the
columns, and established stakes 4, 5, and 10 feet high, returning on the
22nd of February, after an interval of six weeks, to observe the result of
his experiment. He found the two shorter stakes completely masked with
ice, forming columns a foot in diameter; and the longest stake, though not
entirely concealed by the ice which had collected upon it, was crowned
with a beautiful capital of perfectly transparent ice. The columns which
had no stakes fixed upon them had also increased somewhat in size, but not
nearly in the same proportion as those which were the subject of Dr.
Oudot's experiment. The thermometer on this day gave 29&deg;&middot;5 F.
and 59&deg; F. as the temperatures.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that I found one very beautiful column, far higher
than any of those mentioned by Dr. Oudot, and higher than those which M.
Billerez saw, formed upon the trunk and branches of a fir-tree. I have now
no doubt that the peculiar shape of another--the largest of the three
columns which were in the cave at the time of my visit--is due to the fact
of its being a collection of several smaller columns, which have in course
of time flowed into one as they increased separately in bulk, and that its
height has been augmented by a device similar to that adopted by Dr.
Oudot. The two magnificent <a name="Page_291"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;291]</span></a> capitals which this column possessed, as well
as the numerous smaller capitals which sprang from its sides, will thus be
completely accounted for.</p>

<p>One more account may be mentioned, before I proceed to the theory which
has found most favour in Switzerland of late years. M. Cadet published
some <i>Conjectures</i> on the formation of the ice in this cavern, in the
<i>Annales de Chimie,</i> Niv&ocirc;se, an XI.<a name="FNanchor188"></a><a
href="#Footnote_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> He saw the cave in the end of
September 1791, and found very little ice--not a third of what there had
been a month before, according to the account of his guide. The <i>
limonadier</i> of a public garden in Besan&ccedil;on informed him that the
people of that town resorted to the glaci&egrave;re for ice when the
supplies of the artificial ice-houses failed, and that they chose a hot
day for this purpose, because on such days there was more ice in the cave.
Ten <i>chars</i> would have been sufficient to remove all the ice M. Cadet
found, and the air inside the cave seemed to be not colder than the
external air; but, nevertheless, M. Cadet believed the old story of the
greater abundance of ice in summer than in winter, and he attempted to
account for the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The ground above and near the cave is covered with beech and chestnut
trees, and thus is protected from the rays of the sun. The leaves of these
trees give forth abundant moisture, which has been pumped up from their
roots; and as this moisture passes from the liquid to the gaseous state,
it absorbs a large quantity of caloric. Thus, throughout the summer, the
atmosphere is incessantly refrigerated by the evaporation produced by the
trees round the cave; whereas in winter no such process goes on, and the
cave assumes a moderate temperature, such as is usually found in ordinary
caves. Unfortunately for <a name="Page_292"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;292]</span></a> M. Cadet's theory, the facts are not in
accordance with his imaginary data, nor yet with his conclusions. He adds,
on the authority of one of his friends, that the intendant of the
province, M. de Vanolles, wishing to preserve a larger amount of ice in
the cave, built up the entrance with a wall 20 feet high, in which a small
door was made, and the keys were left in the hands of the authorities of
the neighbouring village, with orders that no ice should be removed. The
effect of this was, that the ice diminished considerably, and they were
obliged to pull down the wall again. M. Cadet saw the remains of the wall,
and the story was confirmed by the Brothers of Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu. It would
be very interesting to know at what season this wall was built, and when
it was pulled down. If my ideas on the subject of ice-caves are correct,
it would be absolutely fatal to shut out the heavy cold air of winter from
the grotto.</p>

<p>In 1822, M.A. Pictet, of Geneva, took up the question of natural
glaci&egrave;res, and read a paper before the Helvetic Society of Natural
Sciences,<a name="FNanchor189"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> describing his visits to the caves of
the Brezon and the Valley of Reposoir. In order to explain the phenomena
presented by those caves, M. Pictet adopted De Saussure's theory of the
principle of <i>caves-froides</i>, rendering it somewhat more precise, and
extending it to meet the case of ice-caves. It is well known that, in many
parts of the world, cold currents are found to blow from the interstices
of rocks; and these are utilised by neighbouring proprietors, who build
sheds over the fissures, and so secure a cool place for keeping meat,
&amp;c. Examples of such currents are met with near Rome (in the <i>Monte
Testaceo</i>), at Lugano, Lucerne (the caves of Hergiswyl), and in various
other districts. It is found that the <a name="Page_293"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;293]</span></a> hotter the day, the stronger is the
current of cold air; in winter the direction of the current is changed,
and it blows into the rock instead of out from it.<a name=
"FNanchor190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> De
Saussure's theory, as developed by M. Pictet, was no doubt satisfactory,
so far as it was used to account for the phenomenon of 'cold-caves,' but
it seems to be insufficient as an explanation of the existence of large
masses of subterranean ice; of which, by the way, De Saussure must have
been entirely ignorant, for he makes no allusion to such ice, and the
temperatures of the coldest of his caves were considerably above the
freezing point.</p>

<p>Pictet represents the case of a cave with cold currents of air to be
much the same as that of a mine with a vertical shaft, ending in a
horizontal gallery of which one extremity is in communication with the
open air, at a point much lower, of course, than the upper extremity of
the shaft. The cave corresponds to the horizontal gallery, and the various
fissures in the rock take the place of the vertical shaft, and communicate
freely with the external air. In summer, the columns of air contained in
these fissures assume nearly the temperature of the rock in which they
rest, that is to say, the mean temperature of the district, and therefore
they are heavier than the corresponding external columns of air which
terminate at the mouth of the cave; for the atmosphere in summer is very
much above the mean temperature of the soil, or of the interior of the
earth at moderate depths. The consequence is, that the heavy cool air
descends from the fissures, and streams out into the cave, appearing as a
cold current; and the hotter the day is--that is, the lighter the columns
of external air--the more violent will be the disturbance of equilibrium,
and therefore the more palpable the cold <a name="Page_294"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;294]</span></a> current. Naturally, in this last
case, the air which enters by the upper orifices of the fissures is more
heated, to begin with, than on cooler days; but external heat so very
slightly affects the deeper parts of the fissures, that the columns of air
thus introduced are speedily impressed with the mean temperature of the
district. In winter, the external columns of air are as much heavier than
the columns in the fissures as they are lighter in summer; and so cold
currents of air blow from the cave into the fissures, though such currents
are not of course colder than the external air. Thus the mean temperature
of the cave is much lower than that of the rock in which it occurs; for
the temperature of the currents varies from the mean temperature of the
rock to the winter temperature of the external atmosphere.</p>

<p>The descending columns of warmer air, in summer, must to some extent
raise the temperature of the fissures above that which they would
otherwise possess, that is, above the mean temperature of the place; but
that may be considered to be counteracted by the corresponding lowering of
the temperature of the fissures by the introduction of cold air from the
cave in winter. By a similar reasoning, it will be seen that for some time
after the spring change of direction in the currents takes place, the
temperature of the cave will be less than would have been expected from a
calculation founded on the true mean temperature of the rock through which
the fissures pass. This, together with the fact of the porous nature of
the rock in which most of the curious caves in the world occur, which
allows a considerable amount of moisture to collect on all surfaces, and
thereby induces a depression of temperature by evaporation, may be held to
explain the presence of a greater amount of cold than might otherwise have
been fairly reckoned upon in ice-caves. <a name="Page_295"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;295]</span></a></p>

<p>The idea of cold produced by evaporation Pictet took up warmly,
believing that when promoted by rapid currents of air it would produce ice
in the summer months; and he thus explained what he understood to be the
phenomena of glaci&egrave;res. But it will have been seen, from the
account of the caves I have visited, that the glaci&egrave;res are more or
less in a state of thaw in the summer; and M. Thury's observations in the
winter prove conclusively that they are then in a state of utter frost, so
that the old belief with respect to the season at which the ice is formed
may be supposed to have been exploded. The facts recorded by Mr. Scrope<a
name="FNanchor191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> would
appear to depend upon the peculiar nature of rocks of volcanic formation;
and I am inclined to think there is very little in common between such
instances as he mentions and the large caves filled with ice which are to
be found in the primary or secondary limestone.</p>

<p>One of De Saussure's experiments, in the course of his investigation of
the phenomena and causes of cold currents in caves, is worth recalling. He
passed a current of air through a glass tube an inch in diameter, filled
with moistened stones, and by that means succeeded in reducing the
temperature of the current from 18&deg; C. to 15&deg; C.; and when the
refrigerated current was directed against a wet-bulb thermometer, it fell
to 14&deg; C., thus showing a loss of 7&deg;&middot;2 F. of heat. No one
can see much of limestone caverns without discovering that the surfaces
over which any currents there may be are constrained to pass, present an
abundance of moisture to refrigerate the currents; and it is not
unreasonable to suppose that the large number of evaporating surfaces,
which currents passing through heaps of d&eacute;bris--such as the
basaltic stones described on page 261--come in contact <a name="Page_296">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;296]</span></a> with, are the main cause
of the specially low temperature observed under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Pictet's theory, however, did not convince all those into whose hands
his paper fell, and M.J. Deluc wrote against it in the <i>Annales de
Chimie et de Physique</i> of the same year, 1822.<a name=
"FNanchor192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> Deluc had
not seen any glaci&egrave;re, but he was enabled to decide against the
cold-current theory by a perusal of Pictet's own details, and of one of
the accounts of the cave near Besan&ccedil;on. He objected, that in many
cases the ice is found to melt in summer, instead of forming then; and
also, that in the Glaci&egrave;re of S. Georges, which Pictet had
described, there was no current whatever. Further, in all the cases of
cold currents investigated or mentioned by De Saussure, the presence of
summer ice was never even hinted at, and the lowest temperatures observed
by him were considerably above the freezing point. I may add, from my own
experience, that on the only occasions on which I found a decided current
in a glaci&egrave;re--viz., in the Glaci&egrave;re of Month&eacute;zy, and
that of Chappet-sur-Villaz,--there was marked thaw in connection with the
current. In the latter case, the channel from which the current came was
filled with water; and in the former, water stood on the surface of the
ice.</p>

<p>The view which Deluc adopted was one which I have myself independently
formed; and he would probably have written with more force if he had been
acquainted with various small details relating to the position and
surroundings of many of the caves. The heavy cold air of winter sinks down
into the glaci&egrave;res, and the lighter warm air of summer cannot on
ordinary principles of gravitation dislodge it, so that heat is very
slowly spread in the caves; and even when some amount of heat does reach
the ice, the latter melts but slowly, for ice absorbs 60&deg; C. of <a
name="Page_297"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;297]</span></a> heat in
melting; and thus, when ice is once formed, it becomes a material
guarantee for the permanence of cold in the cave.</p>

<p>For this explanation to hold good, it is necessary that the level at
which the ice is found should be below the level of the entrance to the
cave; otherwise the mere weight of the cold air would cause it to leave
its prison as soon as the spring warmth arrived. In every single case that
has come under my observation, this condition has been emphatically
fulfilled. It is necessary, also, that the cave should be protected from
direct radiation, as the gravitation of cold air has nothing to do with
resistance to that powerful means of introducing heat. This condition,
also, is fulfilled by nature in all the glaci&egrave;res I have visited,
excepting that of S. Georges; and there art has replaced the protection
formerly afforded by the thick trees which grew over the hole of entrance.
The effect of the second hole in the roof of this glaci&egrave;re is to
destroy all the ice which is within range of the sun. A third and very
necessary condition is, that the wind should not be allowed access to the
cave; for if it were, it would infallibly bring in heated air, in spite of
the specific weight of the cold air stored within. It will be understood
from my descriptions of such glaci&egrave;res as that of the Grand Anu, of
Month&eacute;zy, and the Lower Glaci&egrave;re of the Pr&eacute; de S.
Livres, how completely sheltered from all winds the entrances to those
caves are. There can be no doubt, too, that the large surfaces which are
available for evaporation have much to do with maintaining a somewhat
lower temperature than the mean temperature of the place where the cave
occurs. This had been noticed so long ago as Kircher's time; for among the
answers which his questions received from the miners of Herrengrund, we
find it stated that, so long as mines are dry, the deeper they are the
hotter; but if they <a name="Page_298"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;298]</span></a> have water, they are less warm, however deep.
From the mines of Schemnitz he was informed that, so long as the free
passage of air was not hindered, the mines remained temperate; in other
cases they were very warm. Another great advantage which some
glaci&egrave;res possess must be borne in mind, namely, the collection of
snow at the bottom of the pit in which the entrance lies. This snow
absorbs, in the course of melting, all heat which strikes down by
radiation or is driven down by accidental turns of the wind; and the
snow-water thus forced into the cave will, at any rate, not seriously
injure the ice. It is worthy of notice that the two caves which possess
the greatest depth of ice, so far as I have been able to fathom it, are
precisely those which have the greatest deposit of snow; and the ice in a
third cave, that of Month&eacute;zy, which has likewise a large amount of
snow in the entrance-pit, presents the appearance of very considerable
depth. The Schafloch, it is true, which contains an immense bulk of ice,
has no snow; but its elevation is great, as compared with that of some of
the caves, and therefore the mean temperature of the rock in which it
occurs is less unfavourable to the existence of ice.</p>

<p>I believe that the true explanation of the curious phenomena presented
by these caves in general, is to be found in Deluc's theory, fortified by
such facts as those which I have now stated. The mean temperature of the
rock at Besan&ccedil;on, where the elevation above the sea is
comparatively so small, renders the temptation to suggest some chemical
cause very strong.</p>

<p>The question of ice in summer where thaw prevails in winter, may fairly
be considered to have been eliminated from the discussion of such caves as
I have seen, in spite of the persistent assertions of some of the
peasantry. The observations, however, in caverns in volcanic formations,
<a name="Page_299"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;299]</span></a> and in
basaltic d&eacute;bris, are so circumstantial that it is impossible to
reject them; and in such cases a theory similar to that enunciated by Mr.
Scrope<a name="FNanchor193"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> seems to be the only one in any way
satisfactory, though I have not heard of such marvellous results being
produced elsewhere by evaporation. One observer, for instance, of the
cavern near the village of Both, in the Eiffel, found a thickness of 3
feet of ice; and in that case it was melting in summer, instead of
forming. In some cases it has been suggested that the length of time
required for external heat or cold to penetrate through the earth and rock
which lie above the caves is sufficient to account for the phenomenon of
summer frost and winter thaw. Thus, it is said, the thickness of the
superincumbent bed may be such that the heat of summer only gets through
to the cave at Christmas, and then produces thaw, while in like manner the
greatest cold will reach the cave in mid-summer. But there is a fatal
objection to this idea in the fact that the invariable stratum--i.e., the
stratum beyond which the annual changes of external temperature are not
felt--is reached about 60 feet below the surface in temperate latitudes,<a
name="FNanchor194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> while
at the tropics such changes are not felt more than a foot below the
surface. Humboldt calculated that in the latitude of central France the
whole annual variation in temperature at a depth of 30 feet would not
amount to more than one degree.<a name="FNanchor195"></a><a href=

<h3>ON THE PRISMATIC STRUCTURE OF THE ICE IN GLACI&Egrave;RES.</h3>

<p>It was natural to suppose that the prismatic structure which I found so
very general in the glaci&egrave;res was the result of some cause or
causes coming into operation after the first formation of the ice. On this
point M. Thury's visit to the Glaci&egrave;re of S. Georges in the spring
of 1852 affords valuable information, for at that time the coating of ice
on the wall, evidently newly formed, did not present the <i>structure
ar&eacute;olaire</i> which he had observed in his summer visit to the
cave. He suggests that, since ice is less coherent at a temperature of
32&deg; F.--which is approximately the temperature of the ice-caves during
several months of the year--than when exposed to a greater degree of cold,
its molecules will then become free to assume a fresh system of
arrangement.<a name="FNanchor196"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> On the other hand, Professor Faraday
has found that ice formed under a temperature some degrees below the
ordinary freezing point has a well-marked crystalline structure.<a name=
"FNanchor197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> M. Thury
suggests also, as a possibility, what I have found to be the case, by
frequent observations, that the prismatic ice has greater power of
resisting heat than ordinary ice; and on this supposition he accounts for
the fact of <a name="Page_301"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;301]</span></a> hollow stalactites being found in the Cavern of
S. Georges.<a name="FNanchor198"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> At the commencement of the hot
season, the atmospheric temperature of the glaci&egrave;res rises
gradually; and when it has almost reached 32&deg; F., the prismatic change
takes place in the ice, extending to a limited depth below the surface.
The central parts of the stalactites retain their ordinary structure, and
are after a time exposed to a general temperature rather above than below
the freezing point; and thus they come to melt, the water escaping either
by accidental fissures between some of the prisms, or by the extremity of
the stalactite, or by some part of the surface which has chanced to escape
the prismatic arrangement, and has itself melted under increased
temperature.<a name="FNanchor199"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p>M. H&eacute;ricart de Thury describes the peculiar structure of the ice
which he found in the Glaci&egrave;re of the Foire de Fondeurle.<a name=
"FNanchor200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> He found
that the crystallised portions were very distinctly marked, displaying for
the most part a six-sided arrangement; and in the interior of a hollow
stalactite he found numerous needles of ice perfectly crystallised, the
crystals being some triangular and some six-sided. He was unable to detect
any perfect pyramid.<a name="FNanchor201"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> I have already quoted Olafsen's
observations on the polygonal lining which <a name="Page_302"><span class=
"pagenum">[Page&nbsp;302]</span></a> he saw on the surface of the ice in
the Surtshellir. The French Encyclop&aelig;dia<a name="FNanchor202"></a><a
href="#Footnote_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> relates that M. Hassenfratz saw
ice served up at table at Chamb&eacute;ry which broke into hexagonal
prisms; and when he was shown the ice-houses where it was stored, he found
considerable blocks of ice containing hexahedral prisms terminated by
corresponding pyramids.</p>

<p>In vol. xv. (New Series) of the American Journal of Science,<a name=
"FNanchor203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> an extract
is given from a letter describing the 'Ice Spring' in the Rocky Mountains,
which the mountaineers consider to be one of the curiosities of the great
trail from the States to Oregon and California. It is situated in a low
marshy 'swale' to the right of the Sweetwater river, and about forty miles
from the South Pass. The ground is filled with springs; and about 18
inches below the turf lies a smooth and horizontal sheet of ice, which
remains the year round, protected by the soil and grass above it. On July
12th, 1849, it was from 2 to 4 inches thick; but one of the guides stated
that he had seen it a foot deep. It was perfectly clear, and disposed in
hexagonal prisms, separating readily at the natural joints. The ice had a
slightly saline taste,<a name="FNanchor204"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> the ground above it being impregnated
with salt, and the water near tasting of sulphur. The upper surface of the
stratum of ice was perfectly smooth.</p>

<p>In Poggendorff's <i>Annalen</i> (1841, Erganzsband,
517-19,--Bou&eacute;, an old offender in that way, says 1842) there is <a
name="Page_303"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;303]</span></a> an
account of ice being found in the Westerwald, near the village of
Frickhofen at the foot of the <i>Dornburg</i>, among basaltic
d&eacute;bris about 500 feet above the sea.<a name="FNanchor205"></a><a
href="#Footnote_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> Commencing at a depth of 2 feet
below the surface, the ice reaches from 20 to 22 feet farther down, where
the loose stones give place to dry sand. The ice is in thin layers on the
stones, and is deposited in the form of clear and regular hexagonal
crystals. The lateral extent through which this phenomenon obtains is from
40 to 50 feet each way, and is greater in winter than in summer. As in
other cases that have been noticed in basaltic d&eacute;bris, the snow
which falls upon the surface here is speedily melted. The <i>Allgemeine
Zeitung</i> (1840, No. 309), from which the account in Poggendorff is
taken, suggested that the melted snow-water which would thus run down
among the interstices would readily freeze below the surface, while the
heavy cold air of winter would be stored up at the lower levels, and the
poor conducting powers of basaltic rock<a name="FNanchor206"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> would favour its permanence through
the summer. The temperature of the cold current which was perceptible in
the parts of the mass of d&eacute;bris where the ice existed was 1&deg; R.
(34&deg;&middot;25 F.). Nothing but a few lichens grow on the surface of
the d&eacute;bris.</p>

<p>These are, I think, all the references I have met with to the prismatic
structure of subterranean ice. But there is an interesting account in
Poggendorff 's <i>Annalen</i>,<a name="FNanchor207"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> by a private teacher in Jena, of the
crystalline appearance of ice under slow thaw near that town. In the
winter of 1840, the Saale was frozen, and the ice remained unbroken till
the middle of January, when the thermometer rose <a name="Page_304"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;304]</span></a> suddenly, and the river in
consequence overflowed the lower grounds, and carried large masses of ice
on to the fields, where it was left when the water subsided. On the 20th
of January the thermometer fell again, and remained below the freezing
point till the 12th of February: some of the ice did not disappear till
the following month.</p>

<p>When the ice had lain a short time, cracks appeared on the surface
exposed to the sun, and spread like a network from the edges towards the
centre of the surface. At first there was no regularity in the connection
of these lines, and the several meshes were of very different sizes. After
a time, the larger meshes split up into smaller, and the system of network
was found to penetrate below the surface, the cracks deepening into
furrows, which descended perpendicularly from the surface, and divided the
ice into long thin rhomboidal pillars. The surface-end of some of these
pillars was strongly marked with right lines parallel to one of the sides
of the mesh, and it was found that there was a tendency in the ice to
split down planes through these lines and parallel to the corresponding
side-plane. Parallel to the original surface of the mass of ice, the
pillars broke off evenly. The side-planes had a rounded, wrinkled
appearance; and their mutual inclinations--as far as could be
determined--were from 105&deg; to 115&deg;, and from 66&deg; to 75&deg;.
When these ice-pillars were examined by means of polarised light, they
were found to possess a feeble double-refracting power.</p>

<p>The writer of the article in Poggendorff suggests a question which he
was not sure how to answer:--Is this appearance in correspondence with the
original formation of the ice, or does it only appear under slow thaw?</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that from the 1st to the 11th of February the
thermometer was never higher than 22&deg;&middot;8 F., <a name="Page_305">
<span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;305]</span></a> and during that time fell
as low as 21&deg; below zero, i.e. 43&deg; below the freezing point.</p>

<p>Professor Tyndall has informed me that in the winters of 1849, 1850,
1851, he found the banks of a river in Germany loaded with massive layers
of drift-ice, in a state of thaw, and was struck by the fact that every
layer displayed the prismatic structure described above, the axes of the
prisms being at right angles to the surfaces of freezing. It may be, he
adds, that this structure is in the first place determined by the act of
freezing, but it does not develop itself until the ice thaws.</p>

<p>M. Hassenfratz observed an appearance in ice on the Danube at Vienna<a
name="FNanchor208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a>
corresponding to that described at Jena. He gives no information as to the
state of the weather or the temperature at the time, nor any of the
circumstances under which the ice came under his notice. One of the masses
of ice which he describes was crystallised in prisms of various numbers of
sides: of these prisms the greater part were hexahedral and irregular.
Another mass was composed of prisms in the form of truncated pyramids; and
in another he found quadrilateral and octahedral prisms, the former
splitting parallel to the faces, and also truncated pyramids with five and
six sides. He adds, that he had frequently seen in the upper valleys tufts
of ice growing, as it were, out of the ground, and striated externally,
but had never succeeded in discovering any internal organisation, until
one evening in a time of thaw, when he found by means of a microscope that
the striated tufts of ice had assumed the same structure on a small scale
as that which he had observed on the Danube.</p>

<p>A Frenchman who was present in the room in which the <a name=
"Page_306"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;306]</span></a> Chemical
Section of the British Association met at Bath, and heard a paper which I
read there on this prismatic structure, suggested that it was probably
something akin to the rhomboidal form assumed by dried mud; and I have
since been struck by the great resemblance to it, as far as the surface
goes, which the pits of mud left by the coprolite-workers near Cambridge
offer, of course on a very large scale. This led me to suppose that the
intense dryness which would naturally be the result of the action of some
weeks or months of great cold upon subterranean ice might be one of the
causes of its assuming this form, and the observations at Jena would
rather confirm than contradict this view: competent authorities, however,
seem inclined to believe that warmth, and not cold, is the producing
cause.<a name="FNanchor209"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a></p>

<p>Professor Tyndall found, in the course of his experiments on the discs
and flowers produced in the interior of a mass of ice by sending a warm
ray through the mass, that the pieces of ice were in some cases traversed
by hazy surfaces of discontinuity, which divided the apparently continuous
mass into irregular prismatic segments. The intersections of the bounding
surfaces of these segments with the surface of the slab of ice formed a
very <a name="Page_307"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;307]</span></a>
irregular network of lines.<a name="FNanchor210"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> I am inclined, however, to think that
the irregularity in these cases proved to be so much greater than that
observed in the glaci&egrave;res, that this interior prismatic subdivision
must be referred to some different cause.</p>

<h3>ON THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE REGIONS IN WHICH THE GLACI&Egrave;RES
OCCUR.</h3>

<p>Many interesting experiments have for long been carried on with a view
to determine the mean temperature at various depths below the surface of
the earth. The construction of Artesian wells has afforded useful
opportunities for increasing the amount of our knowledge on this subject;
and the well at Pregny, near Geneva,<a name="FNanchor211"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> and the Monk Wearmouth coal-mines, as
observed by Professor Phillips while a fresh shaft was being sunk,<a name=
"FNanchor212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a> have
supplied most valuable facts. Without entering into any detail, which
would be an unnecessary trouble, it may be stated generally, that, under
ordinary circumstances, 1&deg; F. of temperature is gained for every 50 or
60 feet of vertical descent into the interior of the earth. I have only
met with one account of an experiment made in a horizontal direction, and
it is curious that the law of the increase of temperature then observed
seemed to be very much the same as that determined by the mean of the
vertical observations. Boussingault<a name="FNanchor213"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> found several horizontal adits in a
precipitous face of porphyritic syenite among the mountains of Marmato. In
one of these adits--a gallery called Cruzada, at an elevation of 1,460
m&egrave;tres--he found an <a name="Page_309"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;309]</span></a> increase of 1&deg; C. of mean temperature for
every 33 m&egrave;tres of horizontal penetration, or, approximately,
1&deg; F. for 60 feet.<a name="FNanchor214"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p>Again, observations have been made, in various latitudes, of the
decrease of temperature consequent upon gradual rising from the general
surface of the earth; as, for instance, in the ascent of mountains.
Speaking without any very great precision, but with sufficient accuracy
for ordinary purposes, 1&deg; F. is lost with every 300 feet of ascent.<a
name="FNanchor215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> It is
evident that this decrease will be less rapid where the slope of ascent is
gradual, from such considerations as the angle at which the sun's rays
strike the slope, and the larger amount of surface which is in contact
with a stratum of atmosphere of any given thickness.</p>

<p>With these data, it is easy to arrive at some idea of the probable mean
temperature of the rock containing several of the glaci&egrave;res I have
described. The elevation of some of them has not been determined with
sufficient accuracy to make the results of any calculation trustworthy;
but four cases may be taken where the elevation is known--namely, the
Glaci&egrave;res of S. Georges, S. Livres, Month&eacute;zy, and the
Schafloch. If we take as a starting point the mean temperature of the town
of Geneva, which has been determined at 49&deg;&middot;55 F., the
elevation of that town being <a name="Page_310"><span class="pagenum">
[Page&nbsp;310]</span></a> nearly 1,200 feet, we obtain the following
approximate results for the mean temperature of the surface at the points
in question:--</p>

<tr>
<td>Month&eacute;zy</td>

<td>41&deg;&middot;55 "</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The law of decrease of temperature enunciated by M. Thury gives a
higher mean temperature for the surface of the earth in these places, as
in the following table:--</p>

<table frame="void" summary="Second table of Mean Temperatures">

<td>42&deg;&middot;5 "</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If any certain information could be obtained of the elevation of the
Abbey of Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu, I am sure that a result more surprising than
that in the case of the Glaci&egrave;re of Month&eacute;zy would appear.
The elevation of the floor of the church in the citadel of Besan&ccedil;on
is 367&middot;7 m&egrave;tres, and the plateau on the north side of the
town of Baume-les-Dames is 531&middot;9 m&egrave;tres. I am inclined to
think, from the look of the country, that the latter possesses much the
same elevation as the valley in which the Abbey lies; and in that case we
should have comparatively a very high mean temperature for the surface in
the neighbourhood where the glaci&egrave;re occurs.</p>

<p>But if these are the mean temperatures of the surface, the natural
temperatures of the caves themselves should be still higher, on account of
the allowance to be made for increase of temperature with descent into the
interior of the earth. This element will very materially affect our
calculations in such a case as the lower part of the ice in the
Glaci&egrave;re of the Pr&eacute; de S. Livres, and the strange suggestive
beginning of a new ice-cave 190 feet below the surface, <a name=
"Page_311"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;311]</span></a> on the
Montagne de l'Eau, near Annecy. In any open pit or cave, the ordinary
atmospheric influences find such easy access, that the temperature cannot
be expected to follow the law observed when perforations of small bore are
made in the earth, as in the case of the preliminary boring before
commencing to dig a well;<a name="FNanchor216"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> but the two glaci&egrave;res
mentioned above are so completely protected in their lowest parts, that
they may be treated as if they were isolated from external influence of
all ordinary kinds; and it may fairly be said that the mean temperature
there ought to be considerably higher than at the surface.</p>

<p>It is not very likely that the results of the above calculations are
strictly in accordance with what a careful series of observations on the
spot might show. The distance between Geneva and the Glaci&egrave;res of
S. Georges and S. Livres is sufficiently small to make it probable that
the reality is not very far different from the calculated temperature; but
the other two caves are comparatively so far off, that the temperature and
elevation of Geneva are not very safe data to build upon.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<p>M. Thury's observations during his winter visit to the Glaci&egrave;re
of S. Georges are so curious and valuable, that I give the principal
results of them here.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that this glaci&egrave;re consists of a roomy
cave, 110 feet long and 60 feet high, with two orifices in the higher part
of the roof, one of which is kept covered with the trunks of trees to shut
out the direct radiation of the sun. A little thought suggested to M.
Thury that the cold in the cave in mid-winter would most probably be
greater than the external cold of the day, and less than that of the
night; so that there should be a time in the later evening when a column
of colder and heavier air would begin, to descend through the hole in the
roof. To test the correctness of this supposition, he took up his abode in
the cavern for the evening of the 10th January, 1858, with a lighted
candle. The flame burned steadily for some time; but at 7.16 P.M. it began
to flicker, and soon inclined downwards through an angle of about 45&deg;;
and when M. Thury placed himself under the principal opening, the flame
was forced into an almost horizontal position. At 8 P.M. the current of
air had all but disappeared. This violent and temporary disturbance of
equilibrium was a matter of much surprise to M. Thury; for he had
naturally expected a quiet current downwards, continuing through the
greater part of the night.</p>

<p>At 7.16 P.M. the external temperature was 23&middot;9&deg; F., and the
temperature of the atmosphere in the cave at the same time was
30&deg;&middot;88 F.;<a name="FNanchor217"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> so that there is no wonder the
current of air should be strong. It is very difficult to say, however, why
it did not commence much earlier, considering that the external air must
have been heavier than that in the cave long before 7 o'clock. M. Thury
refers to the mirage as a somewhat similar instance, that <a name=
"Page_314"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;314]</span></a> phenomenon
being explained by the supposition that atmospheric layers of different
temperatures lie one above another in clearly-defined strata. He suggests,
also, that as the heavier air tends to pass down into the cave, the less
cold air already in the cave tends to pass out; and the narrow entrance
confining the struggle between the opposing tendencies to a very small
area, the weaker initial current is able for a time to hold its own
against the intruder. On this supposition, it is easy to see that when the
rupture does occur it will be violent.</p>

<p>The next day, M. Thury arrived at the glaci&egrave;re at 9.50 A.M. He
had determined, in the summer, that the temperature of the cave was
invariable, at any rate through the 3-1/2 hours of his visit (from 7.30 to
11 A.M.); but his winter experience was very different. The following are
the results of his observations.</p>

<p>The minimum temperature of the external air during the night of January

upon the difference between the temperatures at 7.16 P.M. on the 9th, and

<p>M. Thury bored a hole, of about 10 inches in depth, in the flooring of
ice, and placed a thermometer in it, at 12.25 P.M., closing it up with
cotton. At 2.55 P.M., and at 4.7. P.M., the thermometer marked the same
temperature, namely, 26&deg;&middot;24 F.</p>

<p>M. Thury's views on glaci&egrave;res in general, based upon the details
of the three which he has visited, are much the same as those which I have
expressed. He has, however, more belief than I in 'cold currents.'</p>

<p>It is possible that the freezing of the surface may play a curious part
in the phenomena of the spring season in such caves. Supposing the surface
to be completely frost-bound, all atmospheric pressure will be removed
from the upper surface of the water in the long fissures, and thus water
may be held in suspension, in the centre of large masses of fissured rock,
during the winter months. The first thorough thaw will have the same
effect as the removal of the thumb from the upper orifice in the case of
the hand-shower-bath; and the water thus rained down into the cave will
have a temperature sufficiently high to destroy some portion of the cold
stored up by the descent of the heavy atmosphere of winter, or at least to
melt out the ice which may have blocked up the lower ends of the
fissures.</p>

<p>These ladders have at best but little stability, as they consist of two
uprights, careless about the coincidence of the holes, with bars poked
loosely through and left to fall out or stay in as they choose, the former
being the prevailing choice. One of the ladders happened to be firmer than
the generality of its kind; but, unfortunately, its legs were of unequal
lengths, and so it turned round with one of my sisters, leaving her
clinging like a cat to the under side. When the bars are sufficiently

<p>My sisters made a two-days' excursion from Arzier to this
glaci&egrave;re in the autumn of 1862, and found no snow in the bottom of
the pit. They took the route by Gimel to Bi&egrave;re, intending to defer
the visit to the glaci&egrave;re to the morning of the second day; but
being warned by the appearance known locally as <i>le sappeur qui
fume</i>, a vaporous cloud at the mouth of a cavern near the Dent d'Oche,
on the other side of the Lake of Geneva, they caught the communal forester
at once, and put themselves under his guidance. The distance from
Bi&egrave;re is two hours' good walking, and an hour and a half for the
return. There was no ladder for the final descent, and the neighbouring
ch&acirc;let could provide nothing longer than 15 feet, the drop being 30
feet. Two Frenchmen had attempted to make their way to the cave a week
before; but the old 30-foot ladder of the previous year broke under the
foremost of them, and he fell into the pit, whence he was drawn up by
means of a cord composed of rack-ropes from the ch&acirc;let, tied
together. However useful a string of cow-ties may be for rescuing a man
from such a situation, A. and M. did not care to make use of that
apparatus for a voluntary descent, so they were perforce contented with a
distant view of the ice from the lower edge of the pit.</p>

<p>The most curious pit of this kind is the <i>frais-puits</i> of Vesoul,
in the Vosgian Jura, which pours forth immense quantities of water after
rain has fallen in the neighbourhood. The water rushes out in the shape of
a fountain, and on one occasion, in November 1557, saved the town of
Vesoul from pillage by a passing army. This pit is carefully described by
M. Hassenfratz, in the <i>Journal de Physique</i>, t. xx. p. 259 (an.
1782), where he says that C&aelig;sar was driven away from the town of
Vesoul, which he had intended to besiege, by the floods of water poured
forth from the <i>frais-puits</i>. I know of no such incident in
C&aelig;sar's life, though M. Hassenfratz quotes C&aelig;sar's own words:
the town of Vesoul, too, had no historical existence before the 9th or
10th century of our era. There is also a pit near Vesoul which contains
icicles in summer, and may be the same as the <i>frais-puits</i>, for the
old historian of Franche Comt&eacute;, Gollut, in describing the latter,
mentions that it is so cold that no one cares to explore it (pp. 91.

<p>He was in error. The Paris correspondent of the 'Times' gave, some
months since (see the impression of Jan. 20, 1865), an account of an
interesting trial respecting the manufacture of the liqueur peculiar to
the Abbey of Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu. From this account it appears that the
liqueur was formerly called the Liqueur of the Gr&acirc;ce-Dieu, but is
now known as Trappistine. It is limpid and oily; possesses a fine aroma, a
peculiar softness, a mild but brisk flavour, and so on. It was invented by
an ecclesiastic who was once the Brother Marie-Joseph, and prior of the
convent, but is now M. Stremler, having been released by the Pope from his
vows of obedience and poverty, in order that he might teach Christianity
to the infidels of the New World. The Brothers took the question of the
renunciation of poverty into their own hands, by declining to give up the
money which Brother Marie-Joseph had originally brought into the society;
so M. Stremler, being now moneyless, commenced the secular manufacture of
the seductive Trappistine, in opposition to the regular manufacture within
the walls of the Abbey, abstaining, however, from the use of the religious
label which is the Brothers' trade-mark. The unfortunate inventor was
fined and condemned in costs for his piracy.</p>

<p>One of the rights of the sovereigns of Burgundy was known by this name.
The sovereign had the power of sending one soldier incapacitated by war to
each abbey in the County, and the authorities of the abbey were bound to
make him a prebendary for life. In 1602, after the siege of Ostend, the
Archduke Albert exercised this right in favour of his wounded soldiers,
forcing lay-prebendaries upon almost all the abbeys of the County of
Burgundy. The Archduchess Isabella attempted to quarter such a prebendary
upon the Abbey of Migette, a house of nuns, but the inmates successfully
refused to receive the warrior among them (Dunod, <i>Hist. de
l'&Eacute;glise de Besan&ccedil;on</i>, i. 367). For the similar right in
the kingdom of France, see Pasquier, <i>Recherches de la France</i>, l.
xii. p. 37. Louis XIV. did not exercise this right after his conquest of
the Franche Comt&eacute;, perhaps because the H&ocirc;tel des Invalides,
to which the Church was so large a contributor, met all his wants.</p>

<p>The following remarks may give some explanation of the phenomenon of
alternating currents in this cave, I should suppose that during the night
there is atmospheric equilibrium in the cave itself, and in the three pits
A, B, C. When the heat of the sun comes into operation, the three pits are
very differently affected by it, C being comparatively open to the sun's
rays, while A is much less so, and B is entirely sheltered from radiation.
This leads naturally to atmospheric disturbance. The air in the pit C is
made warmer and less heavy than that in A and B, and the consequence is,
that the column of air in C can no longer balance the columns in A and B,
which therefore begin to descend, and so a current of air is driven from
the cave into the pit C. Owing to the elasticity of the atmosphere, even
at a low temperature, this descent, and the consequent rush of air into C,
will be overdone, and a recoil must take place, which accounts for the
return current into the cave from the pit C. The sun can reach A more
easily than B, and thus the air is lighter and more moveable in the former
pit, so that the recoil will make itself more felt in A than in B:
accordingly, we found that the main currents alternated between A and C,
with very slight disturbance in the neighbourhood of B. B will, however,
play its part, and the weighty column of air contained in it will
oscillate, though with smaller oscillations than in the case of A.
Probably, when the sun has left A, while acting still upon C, the return
current from C will be much slighter, and there will be a general settling
of the atmosphere in the pits A and B, until C also is freed from the
sun's action, when the whole system will gradually pass into a state of
equilibrium.</p>

With respect to the action of the more protected pits, the principle of
the hydraulic ram not unnaturally suggests itself. In considering the
minor details of the currents, such elements as the refrigeration of the
air in its passage across the face of the ice must be taken into account.
It may be observed that the candle did not occupy an <i>intermediate</i>
position with respect to two opposing currents, for it was practically on
the floor of the cave, owing to the continuity of the slope of snow on
which it stood, as shown in the vertical section on p. 108.<br />

article called <i>An Ice-cavern in the Justis-Thal.</i> The writer
says&mdash;'We proceeded to the farther end of the cavern, or at least as
far as we thought it prudent, to ascertain where the flooring of ice
rounded off into the abyss of unfathomable water we heard trickling
below.' One of the party 'having taken some large stones with him, he
began hurling them into the profound mystery. Presently a heavy
double-bass gurgle issued forth with ominous depth of voice, indicating
the danger of farther progress. Having thus ascertained that if either of
us ventured farther he would most probably not return by the way he went,
the signal of retreat was given, and in about forty minutes, after
encountering the same amusing difficulties which had enlivened our
descent, &AElig;neas-like we gained the upper air.' It will be seen from
my account of what we found in the 'abyss of unfathomable water,' that a
little farther exploration might have effected a change in the writer's
views.</p>

these caves, which is not entirely melted before the commencement of the

vast masses of ice broken up into a thousand fantastic forms, and
presenting by their lucidity a singular contrast to the sombre vaults and
massive stalactites of the cavern.'</p>

found the lowest temperature of the currents of cold air to be
36&ordm;&middot;5 F.; but M. Girou de Buzareingues <i>(Ann. de Chimie et
de Phys</i>., xlv. 362) found that with a strong north wind, the
temperature of the external air being 55&ordm;&middot;4 F., the coldest
current gave 35&ordm;&middot;6 F.; with less external wind, still blowing
from the north, the external air lost half a degree centigrade of heat,
while the current in the cave rose to 38&ordm;&middot;75 F. The cellars in
which the famous cheese of Roquefort is ripened are not subterranean, but
are buildings joined on to the rock at the mouths of the fissures whence
the currents proceed. They are so valuable, that one, which cost 12,000
francs in construction, sold for 215,000 francs. The cheese of this
district has had a great reputation from very early times. Pliny (<i>Hist.

Javoux</i>). The idolaters of Gevaudan offered cheeses to demons by
throwing them into a lake on the Mons Helanus <i>(Laz des Helles?</i>) and

<p>According to the latest accounts I have been able to obtain, a
temperature of 29&middot;75&deg; F. had already been reached some years
ago; the temperature, a few feet from the surface, being 14&deg; below
freezing. The soil here only thaws to a depth of 3 feet in the hottest
summer. Sir R. Murchison wrote to Russia, in February last, for further
information regarding this well.</p>

<p>Since I wrote this, Sir Roderick Murchison has applied to the Secretary
of the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg for further information
respecting the investigations at Jakutsk. The Secretary gives a reference
to Middendorff's <i>Sibirische Reise</i>, Bd. iv. Th. i., 3te Lieferung,
<i>Klima</i>, 1861. I have only been able to find the edition of 1848-51;
but in that edition, under the heading <i>Meteorologische
Beobachtungen</i>, elaborate tables of the meteorological condition of
Jakutsk are given (i. 28-49). Also, under the heading <i>Geothermische
Beobachtungen</i>, very careful information respecting the frozen earth
will be found (i. 157, &amp;c., and 178, &amp;c.). The point at which a
temperature of 32&deg; will be attained, is reckoned variously at from 600
to 1,000 feet below the surface.</p>

of Zurich (September 1668), concerning the Icy and Chrystallin Mountains
of Helvetia, called the Gletscher, English'd out of Latin' (<i>Phil.

the prismatic structure of ice on a large scale. The English version is as
follows:&mdash;'The snow melted by the heat of the summer, other snow
being faln within a little while after, and hardened into ice, which by
little and little in a long tract of time depurating itself turns into a
stone, not yielding in hardness and clearness to chrystall. Such stones
closely joyned and compacted together compose a whole mountain, and that a
very firm one; though in summer-time the country-people have observed it
to burst asunder with great cracking, thunder-like.'</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
